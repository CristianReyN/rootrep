     <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I currently work on the Data Center Strategy team. My primary responsibilities 
      include financial modeling for data center consolidation efforts, supporting 
      the development of workload placement strategies, and performing a variety 
      of analyses on our current data center portfolio and application hosting 
      functions that help drive the strategy for the bank's data centers. </p>
    <h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
    <p>I interned with Bank of America in the summer of 2006 and really enjoyed 
      the experience. The bank is large enough that there are many options available 
      for someone starting their career. I felt like I could gain a variety of 
      experiences working here to set a foundation for a career. </p>
    
    <h4>What is the best thing about living and working in your location?</h4>
    <p>I enjoy working in Charlotte for several reasons. First off, the climate 
      is great! Growing up in the Midwest I was used to long and cold winters, 
      but I don't have to put up with snow and ice anymore. I like that Charlotte 
      has a small but fun downtown that is relatively affordable compared to other 
      larger cities. Being only a few hours from the coast and the mountains are 
      also a big plus. </p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>For those considering an opportunity at Bank of America, coming directly 
      from their undergraduate school, I would encourage them to have a good idea 
      of what their strengths are based on their degree, but to be flexible in 
      what areas they may work. It's good to try a position or rotation that's 
      just outside their area of knowledge, because that will create new experiences 
      and can help find new areas they may not have realized would be a good fit.
