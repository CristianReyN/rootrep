    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
<p>Currently, I work for Vulnerability Management in the Enterprise Technology & Delivery organization. Vulnerability Management is responsible for anticipating and defending Bank of America from internal and external Information Security Threats. My primary responsibilities are both strategic and operational. Strategically, I develop and assist in the automation of the tools and services we provide and resource management strategies. Operationally, I manage a portion of the Enterprise Information Management Control Framework to constantly blend business and risk management, people, processes, and technology.</p>

<h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
<p>Honestly, two major things attracted me to Bank of America: Bank of America and its associates are driven to win and secondly, Bank of America balances its role as a financial institution with creating a great work/life balance for its associates and constantly giving back to the community.</p>

<h4>I remain at Bank of America because&#133;?</h4>
<p>I remain at Bank of America because the company has lived up to my expectations. I can strike a true work/life balance and am rewarded for my success and challenged to improve on my failures.</p>

<h4>Who is the most influential person in your
Bank of America career and why?</h4>
<p>The most influential person in my Bank of America career has been my initial hiring manager Chad. Like many associates, Chad strikes that balance between being a great manager of talent, a friendly person, and a very smart problem solver. He has been a solid mentor and friend since I started at Bank of America.</p>

<h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at
Bank of America?</h4>
<p>I would recommend looking at the bank’s core values. Doing the Right Thing. Trusting and Teamwork. Inclusive Meritocracy. Winning. Leadership. After understanding the core values, determine if they make sense for you as a person. If so, Bank of America may be the place for you. They are not just core values meant to fill a page in an annual report. They are values that our associates live and act on every day.</p>

<h4>If you participated in a summer intern program at
Bank of America, describe your experience and the
value of your internship.</h4>
<p>The summer internship experience gave me a great flavor for the work environment and life as a Bank of America associate. As soon as I was involved in my organization, I was give responsibility to execute on a short-term project for the summer. I also was exposed to mentorship and peer coaching opportunities.</p>

<h4>What was the best deal/project you worked on?</h4>
<p>As a Technology MBA intern, I championed a project that would strategically change the way our organization thinks about Information Security Threats at Bank of America. Our organization struggles with being able to articulate the risk of threat in quantifiable ways that a business partner would understand. We developed a framework to begin to quantify the threat and control environment and a playbook to help better deploy new controls as we identified them. </p>
