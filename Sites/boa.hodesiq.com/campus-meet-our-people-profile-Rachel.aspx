                <p>Undergrad &ndash; W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University</p>

        <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
<p>My first Supply Chain Management Associate Program (MAP) rotation is with
the Global Records Management team. I have supported this team as the
Transportation & Logistics Lead on a multi-phased supplier conversion of
over 1.8MM Bank of America documents from off-site storage locations
across the nation.</p>

<p>Also, I am responsible for managing a certified women-owned supplier
through the bank’s supplier management routines. The project will help
increase inventory visibility and aligns with my team’s goal to create a
world-class records management program.</p>

<h4>What is the most challenging part of your job?</h4>
<p>Managing a team of peers has been my greatest challenge this year.
I’ve learned that it’s about more than delegating responsibility and
setting timelines. You have to take the time to get to know your team
and what motivates each team member to get the job done.</p>

<h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
<p>The rotational opportunity to have multiple experiences and coaching
with exposure across the businesses drew me in. My school work
focused heavily on supply chain in manufacturing industries, and I was
interested in exploring supply chain functions in a service industry.</p>
    
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at
Bank of America?</h4>
<p>Remember to interview your interviewer! Your interviewer can provide a wealth
of insight into the corporate culture and opportunities to grow within the MAP
program and advance after the program. If you take the time to speak with your
interviewer, I think you’ll see this program combined with the flexible corporate
culture is a great fit for a recent graduate.</p>

<h4>What other activities do you enjoy outside of your work day?</h4>
<p>I’ve volunteered with the MAP Program and Team Bank of America to
support Classroom Central, Operation Christmas Child, and
Junior Achievement. The next project I’m involved in is
the Annual Animal Expo with Team Bank of America.
I’ve also participated in events with an Alumni chapter
of Alpha Kappa Psi professional business fraternity
and Kiwanis.</p>
