    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I am currently with Managed Account Advisors which implements product for 
      the advisory channel. My desk is responsible for product strategy and business 
      development. </p>
    <h4>What was the best deal/project you worked on?</h4>
    <p>The product I work with is relatively new, but it is a dynamic solution 
      for our clients because it can incorporate equities, fixed income, and alternative 
      investments all in a single asset allocation portfolio. My role was to describe 
      the investment and operational details regarding the product and then serve 
      as our team's contact with the advisor group to help get them started. Presenting 
      this structure, and how it can meet client needs, is exciting. When given 
      that opportunity, my team was successful in closing an advisor deal that 
      will hopefully bring new assets to the Bank. </p>
    <h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
    <p>The culture is what initially drove me to accept my internship. Everyone 
      I met, from alumni, to product directors and human resources, was friendly 
      and informative; they were people I wanted to work with and be associated 
      with. Diversity and personality are very important to me and both are abundant 
      at our company. </p>
    <h4>What is the best thing about living and working in your location?</h4>
    <p>I grew up in New York and I love being back here after graduating from 
      business school. The energy of the city and the concentration of finance 
      and asset management professionals make New York the ideal place to work 
      in this field. New York has so much culture to offer from entertainment, 
      the arts, to restaurants; it is a global city. </p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>The environment remains competitive, and Bank of America is one of the 
      premier banks on Wall Street, so I would recommend that prospective candidates 
      do their homework and focus in on what they would like to accomplish &ndash; where 
      the fit is. Bank of America is a global and diversified financial services 
      company, with a myriad of career path opportunities. </p>
    <h4>Describe your experience and the value of your experience in the Bank 
      of America summer intern program. </h4>
    <p>I was fortunate to have started my career here as an MBA Associate in the 
      summer intern program. It provided a great foundation; I was able to meet 
      with senior professionals and build a strong network with fellow Analysts 
      and Associates in my class. My summer went so well that I returned to my 
      group upon receiving my full-time offer. </p>
