    <h4>What is a typical day in your life at Bank of America?</h4>
    <p><strong>8:30 &ndash; 9:00 AM:</strong> Arrive at desk, check emails if 
      anything went bad during the evening (tests, calibrations, request for support).</p>
    <p><strong>9:00 &ndash; 10:00 AM:</strong> Speak with traders if they have 
      any requests, or need any assistance.</p>
    <p><strong>10:00 &ndash; Noon:</strong> Respond to requests if any, otherwise 
      work on my projects.</p>
    <p><strong>Noon &ndash; 12:30 PM:</strong> Lunch break</p>
    <p><strong>12:30 &ndash; 8:00 PM:</strong> Working on my projects and be there 
      if any trader requires assistance. In my projects, the first step is usually 
      reading mathematical as well as some financial articles. Then I start working 
      on my model discussing it with my manager or my colleagues. After the model 
      is done, I start implementing it using C++ and spreadsheet development. 
      And then there's the testing phase where we test the results, and we discuss 
      the results with the traders. The final phase is to get the model approved 
      by the risk management team and deploy it to be used in live trading. </p>
    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I am an Equity exotics quantitative researcher. Basically, we create mathematical 
      models for the financial markets, especially for pricing and risk management 
      of derivatives and options. My role can be split in two types of activities: 
      modeling and traders' support. We also get to work with the risk management 
      team, that validates our models, and middle office that uses our model to 
      calculate the PnL pay for our trading team. </p>
