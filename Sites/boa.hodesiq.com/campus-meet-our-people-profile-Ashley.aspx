    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I am in the CFO Group supporting Customer Segments &amp; Deposits. Specifically, 
      I am responsible for providing financial and analytical support for the 
      Checking Product Management team. My daily responsibilities include anything 
      from performance reporting and forecasting, to business partnering with 
      senior leaders in finance and the line of business, and assisting with business 
      cases for checking products. </p>
    <h4>What is the most challenging aspect of your job?</h4>
    <p>Bank of America is constantly changing and adapting to our competitive 
      environment. It's always a challenge to keep up with the ever-changing businesses 
      within our organizational structure, so the most challenging part of my 
      job is ensuring I'm staying up to date with who is responsible for what, 
      within our organization. </p>
    <h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
    <p>The FMAP Program. I had the opportunity to join a two-year management development 
      program in Finance. This rotational program gave me the opportunity to not 
      only develop my skill set, but also learn with hands-on experience as I 
      worked on various projects at the bank. Bank of America offered the initial 
      training and resources I was looking for, and the opportunity for career 
      advancement after my rotational program ended. </p>
    <h4>Who is the most influential person in your Bank of America career and 
      why?</h4>
    <p>I have a former manager who continues to stay in touch with me, providing 
      guidance and honest feedback on my career development. He has taught me 
      the value of networking and the importance of building relationships with 
      my teammates throughout each of my different roles at the bank. </p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>If there is an opportunity to attend a campus event, I highly encourage 
      you to use that opportunity to begin your networking at the bank. Campus 
      events give you the opportunity to meet various associates at the bank and 
      develop an understanding of what working for Bank of America is like. Often 
      many of the associates attending campus events were recruited through a 
      similar fashion, so they are usually the best people to answer your questions 
      and help you genuinely understand the opportunities you may have at Bank 
      of America. </p>
