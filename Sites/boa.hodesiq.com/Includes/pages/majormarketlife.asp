<p style="margin: 0px;">Bank of America understands that business is about more than just finance - it's about people. So while our efforts are global, our feet remain firmly planted in the communities in which we live and work. With locations coast-to-coast you're sure to find a community that suits your lifestyle. Our two primary locations in the U.S. are Charlotte, NC and New York City, NY.</p>

<H2 class="p"><b>Charlotte, NC</b></H2>
<p style="margin: 12px 0px 6px 0px;">
The Charlotte-Mecklenburg area offers more than a great quality of life, it provides a great quality of living. Known as the Queen City, Charlotte is full of vibrant communities on tree-lined streets with quaint bistros and cafes, boutiques, and eclectic eateries.  With a healthy economy, a lower cost of living than most, plenty of cultural options and a nationally recognized educational system, Charlotte has a lot to offer. A mild-four season climate affords plenty of opportunities to take advantage of the many recreational options in the area. And when you're ready to head out of town, it's a quick drive to either the Blue Ridge Mountains or the beautiful Atlantic Ocean beaches on the North Carolina coast.
</p>
<H2 class="p"><b>New York City, NY</b></H2>
<p style="margin: 12px 0px 6px 0px;">
From Manhattan to the Bronx, from TriBeCa to Chinatown, New York City is like no other place on earth. Only here will you find the diversity, the culture, and the style intensified in such an intriguing way.  There are endless opportunities to experience the best in performing arts and there's no doubt that NYC is a shopper's paradise and a culinary feast. Whether you enjoy museums or concerts, whether you like to eat at 7PM or midnight, you'll find what you are looking for. And whether you live on the Upper West Side, or in Connecticut or New Jersey, public transportation operates 24 hours a day to make commuting easy.
