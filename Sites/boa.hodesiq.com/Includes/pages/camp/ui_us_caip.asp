<h2 class="bac">Overview</h2>
<p class="bac">
Corporate Audit maintains robust processes for reviewing risk and controls throughout the Corporation.  Each business is closely examined and risk assessed whereby decisions to conduct specific audit jobs are made based upon the risk assessments.  When specific audit jobs are conducted each auditor is charged with understanding the process within the business, risk assessing those processes, and evaluating the controls associated with the processes.  This provides the opportunity for each auditor to closely work with and influence each business regarding their control infrastructure.
</p>
<p class="bac">
The businesses that Corporate Audit covers include: Global Corporate and Investment Banking, Global Wealth and Investment Management, Global Consumer and Small Business Banking, Finance, Application and Infrastructure Technology, and all operations throughout Europe and Asia.
</p>
