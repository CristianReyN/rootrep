<h2 class="bac">Overview:</h2>  
<p class="bac">
Corporate Audit maintains robust processes for reviewing risk and controls throughout the company. Each business is closely examined and risk assessed, whereby decisions to conduct specific audit jobs are made, based upon the risk assessments. When specific audit jobs are conducted, each auditor is charged with understanding the process within the business, risk assessing those processes, and evaluating the controls associated with the processes. This provides the opportunity for each auditor to closely work with and influence each business regarding their control infrastructure.
</p>
<p class="bac">
The businesses that Corporate Audit covers include: Global Markets, Global Banking, Global Wealth Management, Card, Deposits, Home Loans, Staff Support, Technology and all international operations.
</p>
<p class="bac">
Corporate Audit seeks associates who have a desire to adapt and to learn the multiple businesses of the company. As an intern, you will work closely with the internal auditors and learn the processes of Bank of America. The internship will last approximately 10-12 weeks, working a 40-hour work week.
