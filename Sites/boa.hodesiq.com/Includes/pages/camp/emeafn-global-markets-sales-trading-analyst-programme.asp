<h2 class="bac">Qualifications:</h2>
<p class="bac">
Strong academic qualifications are important, but you'll also need to demonstrate drive, innovation and a genuine interest in the financial markets. 
</p>
<p class="bac">

<h2 class="bac">Training:</h2>
<p class="bac">
You&#39;ll begin your career with a formal training programme throughout July and August in New York, along with other newly&ndash;hired analysts from around the world. This will give you an in&ndash;depth introduction to our company, culture and global reach. Quantitative skills are indispensable and financial modelling is an important function, so the training will include full instruction on all the relevant tools, techniques and working practices. You&#39;ll also receive grounding in your chosen business area, as you develop your professional skills and teamwork capabilities. 
</p>
<p class="bac">
Once you join a team within your assigned business, you&#39;ll take on real responsibility from an early stage. You&#39;ll be exposed to on&ndash;going development opportunities throughout the programme and be encouraged to grow your abilities through on&ndash;the&ndash;job learning, structured training and study towards your professional qualifications. We&#39;ll support and reward you on the basis of your individual performance. Ultimately, how far and how quickly you progress will be up to you.
