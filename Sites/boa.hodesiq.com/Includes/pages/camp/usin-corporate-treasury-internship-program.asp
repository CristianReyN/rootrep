<h2 class="bac">Our Business:</h2>
<p class="bac">
Corporate Treasury is a central function at Bank of America whose activities have enterprise-wide impact. The goal of Corporate Treasury is to optimize shareholder value, by providing world-class management of capital, liquidity, interest rate and operational risk; creating a state-of-the-art framework for managing the tradeoffs between risk and return; and training and exporting enterprise leaders.
</p>
<p class="bac">
Because of the nature of Corporate Treasury&#39;s activities, interns are exposed to the financial markets and a top-of-the-house view of Bank of America&#39;s lines of business, allowing each intern to develop a solid understanding of how the company makes money and manages risks.

<h2 class="bac">Overview:</h2>  
<p class="bac">
The objective of the Corporate Treasury Internship Program is to provide students with the opportunity to expand upon their academic foundation - specifically their analytical skills, their knowledge of the finance industry, and their familiarity with a corporate environment.  This program will introduce interns to Bank of America, the Corporate Treasury group, and the Corporate Treasury Analyst Program (CTAP).  In conjunction with their job responsibilities, Corporate Treasury interns will join interns from across the enterprise in training sessions, networking opportunities, and community service events. The internship program also includes formal performance reviews and real-time feedback and coaching, all within an open, supportive, collaborative and driven culture. At the completion of the internship, eligible senior interns may be given the opportunity to interview for the Corporate Treasury Analyst Program.  
</p>
<p class="bac">
In addition to intern-specific events, Corporate Treasury interns will also participate in Corporate Treasury Analyst Program (CTAP) activities throughout the summer. The CTAP Program is a two-year associate development program, providing college graduates the opportunity to rotate through challenging assignments within Corporate Treasury divisions, which include: Global Funding, Global Liquidity Risk Management, Structured Finance, Balance Sheet Management, Capital Management, and Infrastructure and Transition.  The CTAP Program also includes training and networking activities, and a senior management speaker series.
