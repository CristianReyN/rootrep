<div>
<p class="bac">Corporate Treasury is a central function at Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America whose activities have enterprise-wide impact. The goal of Corporate Treasury is to optimize shareholder value by providing world class management of liquidity, interest rate, and operational risk; creating a state of the art framework for managing the tradeoffs between risk and return; and training and exporting enterprise leaders. Because of the nature of Corporate Treasury&#39;s activities, interns are exposed to a top-of-the-house view of Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America&#39;s lines of business which will allow each intern to develop a solid understanding of how the bank makes money and manages risks.</p>

<div>
<p class="bac">The objective of the Corporate Treasury Internship Program is to provide students with the opportunity to expand upon their academic foundation - specifically their analytical skills, their knowledge of the financial industry, and their familiarity with a corporate environment. This program will introduce interns to Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America, the Corporate Treasury group, and the Corporate Treasury Analyst Program (CTAP). Job responsibilities will vary depending on the division in which the intern is placed: Balance Sheet Management, Global Funding, Global Liquidity Risk Management, Rating Agency and Fixed Income Investor Relations, and the Corporate Treasury Chief Operating Office. For further information on the Corporate Treasury divisions and internship responsibilities, please refer to the following page.</p>
<p class="bac">In conjunction with their job responsibilities, Corporate Treasury interns will join interns from across the enterprise in training sessions, networking opportunities, and community service events. Within Corporate Treasury, interns are provided with a formal support network which includes the Program Manager, an Intern Manager, and a Peer Coach. This formal support network helps to ensure each intern is meeting internship program objectives and is prepared for future leadership roles within Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America. In addition, the internship program includes formal performance reviews and real-time feedback and coaching in an open, supportive, collaborative, and driven environment.</p>
<p class="bac">During the summer, Corporate Treasury interns will also participate in Corporate Treasury Analyst Program (CTAP) activities. The CTAP Program is a two-year associate development program which provides college graduates with the opportunity to rotate through challenging assignments within Corporate Treasury. Each CTAP associate will spend one year in two of the Corporate Treasury divisions. The CTAP Program also includes formal training and networking activities as well as a senior management speaker series.</p>
<p class="bac">At the completion of the internship, eligible interns in their senior year may be given an offer to join the Corporate Treasury Analyst Program (CTAP) upon college graduation.</p>
