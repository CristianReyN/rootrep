<h2 class="bac">Overview</h2>

<p class="bac">
We are looking to employ the next generation of technology leaders through our Summer Internship scheme.  Those of you chosen will be exposed to a broad range of technologies covering many diverse environments.  The types of teams you could be placed with would range from development of trading systems using Web services, to establishing a distributed computing framework using in-house developed technologies.  You could also be aligned to the system administrator for a global UNIX platform, or assist in providing first-level support on the one of our State-of-the-Art trading floor. We want all summer associates have a rich and varied working experience, gaining an understanding of what we do and helping to decide that the Banking Industry is the career path to follow.
</p>

<h2 class="bac">Qualifications</h2>

<p class="bac">
Candidates must demonstrate a combination of academic aptitude, quantitative skills, strategic and creative thinking and written and oral communications skills.  In addition you must be realistically expecting to obtain a minimum 2:1 degree or equivalent.
</p>
<p class="bac">
Underlying all this, you must demonstrate dedication to a career in banking technology. It is our commitment to you, to develop you as specialist banking technologists, not technologists who happen to be working in the banking industry.
</p>

<h2 class="bac">Training</h2>

<p class="bac">
Bank of America’s summer analyst programme is the ideal opportunity to gain an introduction into the world of technology. The 10-week programme kicks off with an induction week covering core skills before you hit your desk where you will work along side our fulltime associates.  Throughout the summer, as well as receiving support from your line manager, HR and a buddy, you will also experience a number of social and educational events giving you a great insight into Bank of America. If you perform well over the summer, you may go back to university with a job offer for the following year enabling you to truly focus on your studies.
</p>

<img src="../images/clear.gif" class="bac" alt=""><br clear="all">

<h2 class="bac">Locations</h2>

<p class="bac">
The analyst position is challenging, fast-paced, and requires a great deal of enthusiasm for both technology and the financial services industry.  Summer analysts will be placed in one of our three London sites (Canary Wharf, Bromley or Croydon), but will receive a general offer.  Specific industry group assignments are made before the summer begins.
