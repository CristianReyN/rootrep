	<li>BAC has almost unmatched scale and scope in global financial services; our IS &amp; BC consistently recognized as best in the world</li>
<li>The industry is seeing new and rising threats that can include:  500% increase in phishing sites, 136M viruses, 500% growth in litigation related electronic discovery</li>
<li>More frequent and significant natural events (hurricanes, flu strains and other potential pandemics) threaten business continuity</li>
<li>Growing, increasingly sophisticated criminal activity threaten our business, our brand, and our customers</li>

<li>“Extended Enterprise”: More processing and support functions by third parties outside the bank coupled with global expansion, increase our vulnerability.</li>
