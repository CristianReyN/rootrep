<h2 class="bac">Qualifications:</h2>
<p class="bac">
Impressive academic qualifications, and consistently strong performance in A&ndash;levels and university will need to be combined with drive, innovation and an understanding of global financial markets, products and tools. Sound quantitative skills, ideally supported by a good understanding of statistics, will be important. You should also have teamwork and problem&ndash;solving skills, a willingness to accept responsibility and ask tough questions, and a pragmatic approach.

<h2 class="bac">Training:</h2>
<p class="bac">
We are committed to growing and developing each member of the team.

This will give you a solid grounding in global markets, economics and how Bank of America&#39;s businesses, products and services operate in this global context. 
</p>
<p class="bac">
The network you build during this time will be a tremendous resource to you throughout your career. Once on the desk, you&#39;ll gain hands&ndash;on experience while undergoing a structured rotational assignment, within the main areas of International Corporate Treasury. In addition to formal training, you&#39;ll be assigned a rotation mentor and peer coach to help you establish goals and build business acumen, and to answer any questions.
