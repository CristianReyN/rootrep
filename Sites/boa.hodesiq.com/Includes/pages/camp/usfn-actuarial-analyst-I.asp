<h2 class="bac">Our Business:</h2>
<p class="bac">
Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America&#39;s Insurance Services group protects our customers from events that could damage their asset base, or their ability to provide for their families.  It has a unique competitive advantage in the segment by virtue of several strategic partnerships we are able to leverage, and because insurance and financial protection products are often purchased in conjunction with other life events such as an auto or home purchase, marriage, or college graduation.  Balboa&#39;s lender-placed business is a market leader in the lender-placed auto and homeowners segment, and Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America&#39;s insurance business is a market leader in the credit and debt protection segment. Insurance Services also partners with other businesses throughout the organization, such as Mortgage and Credit Card, to serve the customer seamlessly and comprehensively.
