<h2 class="bac">Overview</h2>
<p class="bac">
Corporate Audit maintains robust processes for reviewing risk and controls throughout the Corporation.  Each business is closely examined and risk assessed whereby decisions to conduct specific audit jobs are made based upon the risk assessments.  When specific audit jobs are conducted each auditor is charged with understanding the processes within the business, risk assessing those processes, and evaluating the controls associated with the processes.  This provides the opportunity for each auditor to closely work with and influence each business regarding their control infrastructure.

<h2 class="bac">Corporate Audit Management Associate Program (CAMAP)</h2>
<p class="bac">
The Corporate Audit Management Associate Program is a three-year associate development program, which aggressively moves associates through rotational assignments within Corporate Audit. This rotational process helps associates develop a solid knowledge base of the functional areas of the Corporate Audit department and the bank. This provides the opportunity for each auditor to work closely with each business regarding their control infrastructure. CAMAP moves associates throughout multiple business areas so that we can develop a team that is highly versatile and knowledgeable across the Company. This approach provides opportunities for each and every associate to have a rewarding and successful career at Bank of America.
