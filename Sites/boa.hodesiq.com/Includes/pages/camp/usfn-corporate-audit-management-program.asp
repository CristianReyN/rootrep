<h2 class="bac">Overview:</h2>  
<p class="bac">
Corporate Audit maintains robust processes for reviewing risk and controls throughout the company. Each business is closely examined and risk assessed, whereby decisions to conduct specific audit jobs are made, based upon the risk assessments. When specific audit jobs are conducted, each auditor is charged with understanding the process within the business, risk assessing those processes, and evaluating the controls associated with the processes. This provides the opportunity for each auditor to closely work with and influence each business regarding their control infrastructure. 
</p>
<p class="bac">
The businesses that Corporate Audit covers include: Global Markets, Global Banking, Global Wealth Management, Card, Deposits, Home Loans, Staff Support, Technology and all international operations. 
</p>
<p class="bac">
The Corporate Audit Rotational Program (CAMP) is a 2&ndash;year associate development program, which aggressively moves associates through rotational assignments within Corporate Audit. This rotational process helps associates develop a solid knowledge base of the functional areas of Corporate Audit and the company. CAMP auditors work closely with various businesses regarding their risk environment and control infrastructure, and help build a team that is highly&ndash;versatile and knowledgeable across the company. In addition, this process provides opportunities for each and every associate to have a rewarding and successful career at Bank of America.
