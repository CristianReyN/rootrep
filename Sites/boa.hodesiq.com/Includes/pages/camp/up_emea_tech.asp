<h2 class="bac">Overview</h2>
<p class="bac">
We are looking to employ the next generation of technology leaders through our graduate schemes.  Successful candidates will be exposed to a broad range of technologies covering many diverse environments.  Responsibilities can range from the development of trading systems using Web services, to establishing a distributed computing framework using in-house developed technologies.  You could be the system administrator for a global UNIX platform, or be providing first-level support on the one of our state-of-the-art trading floor.  You could also be a delivery manager or business analyst, bringing new applications on-line using Waterfall and Agile development lifecycles methodologies.  We carefully match the skills and experiences shown through the interview process to ensure that all new starters have a rich and varied working experience, gaining the expertise critical to build a technology career within the banking industry.

<h2 class="bac">Qualifications</h2>
<p class="bac">
Candidates must demonstrate a combination of academic aptitude, quantitative skills, strategic and creative thinking and written and oral communications skills.  In addition you must have obtained or are realistically expecting to obtain a minimum 2:1 degree or equivalent.
</p>
<p class="bac">
Underlying all this, you must demonstrate dedication to a career in banking technology. It is our commitment to you, to develop you as specialist banking technologists, not technologists who happen to be working in the banking industry.

<h2 class="bac">Training</h2>
<p class="bac">
Depending on which group successful candidates join training will begin in the US initially with analysts from all lines of business.  The programme is a combination of classroom instruction, e-learning modules, case studies and presentations. Throughout the tuition period, analysts have ample opportunities to work closely with professionals and peers across Bank of America. This is a great opportunity to build a network of colleagues from across the company which will prove to be a tremendous resource throughout your career with the bank.
</p>
<p class="bac">
Bank of America places a great deal of emphasis on on-going training for all staff.  Training modules are available to all levels from product specific courses to generic soft skills development.  Whether a new graduate, or seasoned professional, expanding the skills of the associates is paramount to achieving success.
