<div>
<p class="bac">The Applied Technology Program (ATP) is a unique program that allows UNC Charlotte students to perform practical work for the Bank for an extended period of time while pursuing their undergraduate degrees. For the students, the program spans a 17 month period beginning in the spring term of junior year and through the spring term of senior year. The ATP has a unique compensation structure that combines both pay and course credits. In the spring term of their junior year, students will work 19-hour weeks and receive 6 credits. In the summer term, students will work 40-hour weeks for pay. In the fall and spring term of their senior year, students will revert back to working 19-hour weeks, but will receive pay instead of course credits.</p>
