<h2 class="bac">Overview:</h2>  
<p class="bac">
The Applied Technology Program (ATP) is a unique program that allows UNC Charlotte students to perform practical work for the company for an extended period of time, while pursuing their undergraduate degrees. Students begin the program in the spring semester of their junior year for academic credit, as a 6&ndash;credit hour course.  They continue the rest of the program for pay (no academic credit), with a full&ndash;time paid summer internship followed by part&ndash;time work during both semesters of their senior year.
</p>
<p class="bac">
Students will work within the company&#39;s technology group, contributing to efforts ensuring that applications on its global network remain available for customers and associates.  This entails process documentation, application monitoring, user management, assigned projects, and mentorship.
