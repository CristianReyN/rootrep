<h2 class="bac">Overview:</h2>  
<p class="bac">
The Applied Technology Program (ATP) is a unique program, allowing UNC Charlotte students to perform practical work for the company, for an extended period of time, while pursuing their undergraduate degrees.  For the students, the program spans a 17-month period, beginning in the spring term of junior year and running through the spring term of senior year.  The ATP has a unique compensation structure that combines both pay and course credits. In the spring term of their junior year, students will work 19-hour weeks and receive six credits. In the summer term, students will work 40-hour weeks, for pay. In the fall and spring term of their senior year, students will revert back to working 19-hour weeks, but will receive pay instead of course credits.
