<h2 class="bac">Our Business:</h2>
<p class="bac">
The Global Markets group is a premier provider of sales, trading, structuring and advisory services to money managers, hedge funds, pension funds, endowments, financial institutions, governments and corporations around the world. 
</p>
<p class="bac">
Our Global Markets business has a major presence in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific, serving clients in virtually all countries.
</p>
<p class="bac">
Leveraging our local relationships and broad global capabilities, we provide our clients with ideas and market insights, trading services, analytics and new products across a broad spectrum of asset classes - ranging from interest rate and credit products, foreign exchange, real estate and commodities to cash equities and equity-linked products - all with the goal of enabling our clients to maximize their performance.

<h2 class="bac">Overview:</h2>  
<p class="bac">
As an analyst within Global Markets, you will: 
</p>
<ul class="bac">
	<li>Build relationships, knowledge and experience that will open doors to a wide range of future career options and opportunities</li>
	<li>Discover unlimited opportunities to challenge yourself and grow professionally</li>
</ul>
<p class="bac">
In trading desk assignments, analysts support traders, analyzing client and market data to help develop and execute trades, while learning the basics of risk management and market making. 
</p>
<p class="bac">
Sales roles combine analytical and relationship-building skills and usually involve significant client contact. Working with a senior account manager, officer or team to develop and implement a disciplined approach to the sales process, analysts typically prepare market and company research, presentations for client meetings and analyze client business activity. 
</p>
<p class="bac">
In structuring and origination positions, analysts help design and create new securities that enable issuer and investor clients to achieve their objectives. Quantitative skills are indispensable and financial modeling is an important function. Examples of structured securities include collateralized debt obligations or commodity-linked notes. 
</p>
<p class="bac">
As part of our growing organization, you can expect to gain more responsibility, earlier than you might elsewhere.
