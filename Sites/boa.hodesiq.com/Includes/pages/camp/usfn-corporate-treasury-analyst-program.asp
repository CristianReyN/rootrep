<div>
<p class="bac">The CTAP Program is a two-year analyst development program which provides college graduates with the opportunity to rotate through challenging assignments within Corporate Treasury. Each CTAP associate will spend one year in two of the following Corporate Treasury divisions: Balance Sheet Management, Global Funding, Global Liquidity Risk Management, Rating Agency and Fixed Income Investor Relations, or the Corporate Treasury Chief Operating Office. Due to the nature of Corporate Treasury&#39;s activities, CTAPs are exposed to a top-of-the-house view of Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America&#39;s lines of business which allows for each CTAP to develop a solid understanding of how the bank makes money and manages risks. The CTAP Program includes training and networking activities, quarterly performance reviews and real-time feedback and coaching in an open, supportive, collaborative, and driven culture.</p>
<p class="bac nobr">Each CTAP rotation serves a unique function; therefore, the primary responsibilities of CTAP analysts will depend on the rotation in which they are placed. All CTAP analysts will have meaningful assignments; examples include:</p>
<ul class="bac">
	<li>Performing ad-hoc financial analysis and producing reporting that is distributed to executive leadership and board members</li>
	<li>Analyzing data and output from the bank&#39;s asset/liability models to project the core earnings stream (net interest income) of the corporation and evaluating the interest rate sensitivities of those earnings</li>
	<li>Partnering with the Bank funding traders to raise market based liquidity via the issuance of fed funds, repo, structured notes, and other financial instruments</li>
	<li>Measuring, analyzing, and forecasting the bank&#39;s liquidity position, its primary drivers, and sources of funding</li>
	<li>Participating in dialogue and providing support for rating agencies and fixed income investors</li>
	<li>Working with business partners across the company to ensure consistent implementation of subsidiary governance policies</li>
	<li>Performing validations to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data used in forecasts produced by Corporate Treasury and developing an understanding of products on the bank&#39;s balance sheet</li>
