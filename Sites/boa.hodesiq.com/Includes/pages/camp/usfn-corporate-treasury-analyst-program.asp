<h2 class="bac">Overview:</h2>  
<p class="bac">
The Corporate Treasury Analyst Program (CTAP) is a 2&ndash;year associate development program, providing college graduates the opportunity to rotate through challenging assignments within Corporate Treasury. Each CTAP associate will spend one year in two of the following Corporate Treasury divisions: Global Funding, Global Liquidity Risk Management, Structured Finance, Balance Sheet Management, Capital Management, and Infrastructure and Transition.  Because of the nature of Corporate Treasury’s activities, CTAPs are exposed to financial markets and a top&ndash;of&ndash;the&ndash;house view of Bank of America’s lines of business, which will allow each CTAP to develop a solid understanding of how the company makes money and manages risks. The program includes training and networking activities, quarterly performance reviews, and real&ndash;time feedback and coaching, all within an open, supportive, collaborative and driven culture.
