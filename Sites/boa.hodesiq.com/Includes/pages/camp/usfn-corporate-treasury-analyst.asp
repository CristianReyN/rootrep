<p class="bac">
The CTAP Program is a two-year associate development program which provides college graduates with the opportunity to rotate through challenging assignments within Corporate Treasury including Global Funding, Global Liquidity Risk Management, Structured Finance, Balance Sheet Management, and Change Management.  Because of the nature of Corporate Treasury&#39;s activities, CTAPs are exposed to the financial markets and a top-of-the-house view of Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America&#39;s lines of business which will allow each CTAP to develop a solid understanding of how the bank makes money and manages risks.  The CTAP Program includes training and networking activities, quarterly performance reviews and real-time feedback and coaching in an open, supportive, collaborative, and driven culture.
