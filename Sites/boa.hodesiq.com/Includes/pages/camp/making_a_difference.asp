Banks are only as strong as the communities they serve. So we're passionately committed to the neighbors who trust us with their finances. 
</p>
<p class="bac">
Our goal is to create meaningful change in the places where we live and work. So we host a whole range of financial and social initiatives and investments to ensure that our cities and towns are safe, prosperous and vibrant. 
</p>
<p class="bac">
There are many opportunities for you to get involved, too. Last year, our Team Bank of America volunteers donated more than 310,000 hours to help meet critical community needs everywhere our business reaches-across town and across the globe.
