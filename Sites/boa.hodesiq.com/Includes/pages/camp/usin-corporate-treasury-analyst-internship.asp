<p class="bac">
Corporate Treasury is a central function whose activities have enterprise-wide impact. The goal of Corporate Treasury is to optimize shareholder value by providing world class management of capital, liquidity, interest rate and operational risk; creating a state of the art framework for managing the tradeoffs between risk and return; and training and exporting enterprise leaders.

<h2 class="bac">Overview:</h2>  
<p class="bac">
The objective of the Corporate Treasury Analyst Intern Program is to provide students with the opportunity to expand upon their academic foundation - specifically their technical skills, their knowledge of the industry, and their familiarity with a corporate environment.  This program will introduce the students to Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America, the Corporate Treasury group, and the Corporate Treasury Analyst Program (CTAP). In conjunction with their job responsibilities, Interns will participate in training sessions, networking events and community service opportunities.  
</p>
<p class="bac">
As an intern analyst, you will have roles that impact and analyze the corporation&#39;s financials by:
</p>
<ul class="bac">
	<li>Working with Fed Funds and Eurodollar Time Deposits traders who raise short-term funding for the Bank</li>
	<li>Analyzing data and output from the bank&#39;s Asset/Liability Models to project the core earnings stream (net interest income) of the corporation and understanding sensitivities to those earnings</li>
	<li>Contributing to the funding and capital analysis as well as the execution of securitizations transactions</li>
	<li>Compiling monthly and weekly publications focusing on economic analysis, forecasting, quantitative methods, and national data/statistics</li>
	<li>Contributing to the design, development, and execution of projects related to Corporate Treasury initiatives throughout phases of planning, implementation, and control in accordance with Six Sigma </li>
</ul>
<p class="bac">
Interns will create a performance plan at the beginning of the summer. Performance appraisals are then provided twice during the internship: at the mid-point and at the end. At the completion of the internship, eligible interns may be given the opportunity to interview for the Corporate Treasury Analyst Program. 
</p>
<p class="bac">
Interns will participate in Corporate Treasury Analyst Program (CTAP) events throughout the summer. The CTAP program is a two-year associate development program, which aggressively moves associates through rotational assignments within Corporate Treasury. This rotational process helps associates to develop a solid understanding of the core roles and responsibilities of Corporate Treasury, while developing a broad range of skills that are applicable throughout much of the corporation.  Because of the nature of Corporate Treasury&#39;s activities, CTAPs are exposed to all of Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America&#39;s lines of business allowing them to develop a valuable understanding of how the Bank operates as a whole. CTAP associates participate in a variety of activities within Corporate Treasury and bank-wide, designed to foster teamwork, encourage networking, and demonstrate Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America&#39;s values, vision, and culture.
