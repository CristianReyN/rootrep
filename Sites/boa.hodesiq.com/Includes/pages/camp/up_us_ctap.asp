<p class="bac">
Corporate Treasury is a central function whose activities have an enterprise-wide impact. The goal of Corporate Treasury is to optimize shareholder value by providing world class management of capital, liquidity, interest rate and operational risk; creating a state of the art framework for managing the tradeoffs between risk and return; and training and exporting enterprise leaders.

<h2 class="bac">Overview</h2>
<p class="bac">
The Corporate Treasury Associate Program (CTAP) is a two-year Associate Development program, which aggressively moves associates through rotational assignments within Corporate Treasury. This rotational process helps associates to develop a solid understanding of the core roles and responsibilities of Corporate Treasury, while developing a broad range of skills that are applicable throughout much of the corporation.  Because of the nature of Corporate Treasury’s activities, CTAPs are exposed to all of Bank of America’s lines of business allowing them to develop a valuable understanding of how the Bank operates as a whole. CTAP associates participate in a variety of activities within Corporate Treasury and bank-wide, designed to foster teamwork, encourage networking, and demonstrate Bank of America’s vision, values, and culture.   The CTAP program builds relationships and coordinates events with other rotational programs within the Bank to create a strong network of highly talented new associates.
