<h2 class="bac">Training:</h2>

Full&ndash;time Analysts are hired upon completion of their undergraduate/Master&#39;s degree. Your career as an Analyst will begin with a formal training program, which takes place in New York, for all Analysts globally, and is considered one of the best in the industry. Instruction is provided by Bank of America professionals and leading business school professors. 
</p>
<p class="bac">
The training program includes: 
</p>
<ul class="bac">
	<li>A company&ndash;wide orientation program to introduce you to Bank of America</li>
	<li>An overview of the financial markets and essential business skills</li>
	<li>An intensive training program customized for Analysts that prepares you for your placement in Capital Markets, by simulating actual work assignments, covering quantitative fundamentals, and preparing you for life as an Analyst</li>
</ul>
<p class="bac">
After the formal training program, Analysts relocate to the Asia Pacific office that hired them, and begin working. Training continues on the job and through the online learning network for continuing education, as well as relevant classroom training throughout your career. 
</p>

Graduates who join some regional offices may begin employment earlier, and work for the months prior to attending training in New York, which typically takes place in July.
