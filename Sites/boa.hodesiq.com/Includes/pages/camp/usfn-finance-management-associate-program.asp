<p class="bac">
The Finance Management Associate Program (FMAP) is a two&ndash;year Associate Development program, focusing on Corporate Accounting and Corporate Finance functions within Bank of America. The FMAP program provides associates the opportunity to move through two rotational assignments within the Chief Finance Officer&#39;s organization. This rotational process helps associates develop a solid knowledge base of the functional areas of the CFO Group, and a broad range of skills. FMAP associates participate in a variety of activities designed to foster teamwork, encourage networking and demonstrate Bank of America&#39;s vision and culture. You will participate in FMAP events and networking activities, and will be encouraged to further develop leadership skills by leading projects or committees.
