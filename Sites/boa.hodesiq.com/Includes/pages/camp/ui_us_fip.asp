<h2 class="bac">Overview</h2>
<p class="bac">
The objective of the Finance Intern program is to provide students with the opportunity to expand upon their academic foundation - specifically their technical skills, their knowledge of the industry and their familiarity with a corporate environment.  This program will introduce the students to Bank of America, the Finance group and the Finance Management Associate Program. 
</p>
<p class="bac">
Each Intern will participate in a Business or Corporate support role.  Intern roles may support one or more of the following:
</p>
<ul class="bac">
	<li>Analysis and reporting of on-going operations</li>
	<li>Forecasting financial and non-financial trends</li>
	<li>Developing models and performing financial analysis of business investments</li>
	<li>Supporting the corporation’s internal planning and management accounting functions</li>
	<li>Preparing external reports for shareholders and regulatory authorities</li>
	<li>Providing guidance on accounting policy issues and/or taxation issues</li>
</ul>
<p class="bac">
In conjunction with their job responsibilities, Interns will participate in training sessions, informational meetings, networking events and community service opportunities.  These functions also provide exposure to Bank of America and the Finance Management Associate Program.   
</p>
<p class="bac">
Performance evaluations are conducted three times during the internship. At the completion of the internship, eligible interns may be given more information about the opportunities within the Finance Management Associate Program. 
</p>
<p class="bac">
The Finance Management Associate Program (FMAP) is a two-year associate development program, which aggressively moves Finance MAP Associates through rotational assignments within Finance. This rotational process helps associates develop a solid knowledge base of the functional areas of the Finance Group and a broad range of skills.  Finance MAP associates participate in a variety of activities designed to foster teamwork, encourage networking, and demonstrate Bank of America’s vision and culture.  Finance MAP associates are encouraged to further develop leadership skills by leading projects or committees.
