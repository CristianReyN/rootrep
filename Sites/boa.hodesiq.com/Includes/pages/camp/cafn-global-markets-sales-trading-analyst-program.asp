<div>
<h3 class="bac">Sales</h3>
<p class="bac">As a Sales analyst you will focus on a specific product area. You will be responsible for building and maintaining relationships with our clients by matching our services to their needs. You will interact with portfolio managers, research analysts and traders relaying investment research, relevant market information and marketing ideas; and/or executing transactions as an agent for our clients.</p>
<h3 class="bac">Trading</h3>
<p class="bac">There are two primary responsibilities of a trading analyst: learning and adding value in a support role. You need to constantly increase your familiarity with the markets. That means reading financial publications, shadowing traders, executing on trading systems, talking to sales and customers, generating and monitoring your own trade ideas, and more. Adding value will take time, but within a year you should be able to contribute to trade discussions, system decisions, and execution efficiency. As you succeed at both of these tasks, you will begin to take on greater responsibility and eventually help senior traders, put on proprietary trades, and communicate with clients.</p>
