	<li>Preparing external reports for shareholders and regulatory authorities</li>
	<li>Providing guidance on accounting policy issues and/or taxation issues</li>
</ul>
<p class="bac">In conjunction with their job responsibilities, Interns will participate in training sessions, informational meetings, networking events and community service opportunities. These functions also provide exposure to Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America and the Finance Management Associate Program.</p>
<p class="bac">Performance evaluations are conducted three times during the internship. At the completion of the internship, eligible interns may be given more information about the opportunities within the Finance Management Associate Program.</p>
<p class="bac">The Finance Management Associate Program (FMAP) is a two-year Associate Development program that focuses on Corporate Accounting and Corporate Finance functions within Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America. The FMAP program provides associates with the opportunity to move through two rotational assignments within the Chief Finance Officer&#39;s organization. This rotational process helps associates develop a solid knowledge base of the functional areas of the CFO Group and a broad range of skills. Finance MAP associates participate in a variety of activities designed to foster teamwork, encourage networking, and demonstrate Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America&#39;s vision and culture. You will participate in FMAP events and networking activities, and will be encouraged to further develop leadership skills by leading projects or committees.</p>
