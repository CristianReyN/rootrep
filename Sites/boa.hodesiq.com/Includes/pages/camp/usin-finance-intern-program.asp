<h2 class="bac">Overview:</h2>  
<p class="bac">
The objective of the Finance Intern program is to provide students with the opportunity to expand upon their academic foundation &ndash; specifically their technical skills, their knowledge of the industry and their familiarity with a corporate environment. This program will introduce the students to Bank of America, the Finance group and the Finance Management Associate Program.

In conjunction with their job responsibilities, Interns will participate in training sessions, informational meetings, networking events and community service opportunities. These functions also provide exposure to Bank of America and the Finance Management Associate Program.   
</p>
<p class="bac">
Performance evaluations are conducted three times during the internship. At the completion of the internship, eligible interns may be given more information about opportunities within the Finance Management Associate Program.

<p class="bac">
The Finance Management Associate Program (FMAP) is a two&ndash;year Associate Development program, focusing on Corporate Accounting and Corporate Finance functions within Bank of America. The FMAP program provides associates with the opportunity to move through two rotational assignments within the Chief Finance Officer&#39;s organization. This rotational process helps associates develop a solid knowledge base of the functional areas of the CFO Group, and a broad range of skills. FMAP associates participate in a variety of activities designed to foster teamwork, encourage networking and demonstrate Bank of America&#39;s vision and culture. You will participate in FMAP events and networking activities, and will be encouraged to further develop leadership skills by leading projects or committees.
