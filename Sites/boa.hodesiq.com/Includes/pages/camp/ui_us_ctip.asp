<h2 class="bac">Our Business</h2>
<p class="bac">
Corporate Treasury is a central function whose activities have enterprise-wide impact. The goal of Corporate Treasury is to optimize shareholder value by providing world class management of capital, liquidity, interest rate and operational risk; creating a state of the art framework for managing the tradeoffs between risk and return; and training and exporting enterprise leaders.
</p>

<h2 class="bac">Overview</h2>
<p class="bac">
The objective of the Corporate Treasury Intern Program is to provide students with the opportunity to expand upon their academic foundation - specifically their technical skills, their knowledge of the industry, and their familiarity with a corporate environment.  This program will introduce the students to Bank of America, the Corporate Treasury group, and the Corporate Treasury Associate Program (CTAP). In conjunction with their job responsibilities, Interns will participate in training sessions, networking events and community service opportunities.  
</p>
<p class="bac">
As an intern analyst, you will have roles that impact and analyze the corporation’s financials by:
</p>
<ul class="bac">
	<li>Working with Fed Funds and Eurodollar Time Deposits traders who raise short-term funding for the Bank.</li>
	<li>Analyzing data and output from the bank’s Asset/Liability Models to project the core earnings stream (net interest income) of the corporation and understanding sensitivities to those earnings.</li>
	<li>Contributing to the funding and capital analysis as well as the execution of securitizations transactions.</li>
	<li>Compiling monthly and weekly publications focusing on economic analysis, forecasting, quantitative methods, and national data/statistics.</li>
	<li>Contributing to the design, development, and execution of projects related to Corporate Treasury initiatives throughout phases of planning, implementation, and control in accordance with Six Sigma. </li>
</ul>
<p class="bac">
Interns will create a performance plan at the beginning of the summer. Performance appraisals are then provided twice during the internship: at the mid-point and at the end. At the completion of the internship, eligible interns may be given the opportunity to interview for the Corporate Treasury Associate Program. 
</p>
<p class="bac">
Interns will participate in Corporate Treasury Associate Program (CTAP) events throughout the summer. The CTAP program is a two-year associate development program, which aggressively moves associates through rotational assignments within Corporate Treasury. This rotational process helps associates to develop a solid understanding of the core roles and responsibilities of Corporate Treasury, while developing a broad range of skills that are applicable throughout much of the corporation.  Because of the nature of Corporate Treasury’s activities, CTAPs are exposed to all of Bank of America’s lines of business allowing them to develop a valuable understanding of how the Bank operates as a whole. CTAP associates participate in a variety of activities within Corporate Treasury and bank-wide, designed to foster teamwork, encourage networking, and demonstrate Bank of America’s values, vision, and culture.
