<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px 0px;">
The Corporate Treasury Associate Program (CTAP) is a two-year Associate Development program, which aggressively moves associates through rotational assignments within Corporate Treasury. This rotational process helps associates develop a solid understanding of the core roles and responsibilities of Corporate Treasury, while developing a broad range of skills that are applicable throughout much of the Company. Unique to the CTAP experience, is a high degree of exposure to the entire balance sheet of Bank of America - including all the various lines of business. CTAP Associates participate in a variety of activities within Corporate Treasury and the Company as a whole, designed to foster teamwork, encourage networking, and demonstrate Bank of America's vision and culture. The CTAP program builds relationships and coordinates events with other rotational programs within the Bank to create a strong network of highly talented new associates.
