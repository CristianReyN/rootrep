<b>Banking Center Environment</b>
<br><br>
Now that you&acute;ve learned more about Bank of America, let&acute;s take a closer look at the Banking Center Environment. 
<br><br>
Tellers are part of a professional team focused on building relationships, performing quality transactions, finding solutions, inspiring trust, and protecting the Customer and Bank of America.  Tellers are vital to the success of Bank of America. By interacting with customers face to face, they serve as Ambassadors of the Bank.  Our Tellers are supported by leaders and a Team of Associates who provide coaching and assistance in order to facilitate success.
<br><br>
Teller Training and on-going coaching is provided to ensure Tellers have the necessary knowledge and tools to be successful. This allows Tellers to provide the service that exceeds our customers&acute; expectations.  Our environment sets the stage for all associates to take ownership and responsibility for the banking center&acute;s success.
<br><br>
<i>(Testimonial) &ldquo;Everybody works together.  You succeed as a team and you fail as a team so that&acute;s one of big advantages.  You&acute;re not on your own.  Everybody is helping each other so everybody is in a real friendly environment.  You&acute;re like family there.&rdquo;</i>
<br><br>
<i>(Testimonial) &ldquo;You learn a lot with people that come in because some people only have five minutes to get in and out, and if there&acute;s a long line, of course, somebody is going to have to wait on some end, but as long as you keep that great personality and that smile on your face and you let each person know that you&acute;re still caring and you&acute;re there for them and don&acute;t make it seem like you&acute;re being rushed, then they&acute;ll come back to you and still wait on you.&rdquo;</i>
<br><br>
<b>Core Requirements</b>
<br><br>
It&acute;s important to keep in mind the Teller is one of the most important roles at Bank of America, as we represent the face of the company.  As a result, this position requires not only a pleasant personality, but also a very strong customer focus. As you consider a Teller position, we feel that it is important for you to know the key characteristics of those Associates who are typically successful in the role.
<br><br>
Generally, they are people who:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Are focused and organized</li>
	<li>Feel comfortable in working in a fast paced environment</li>
	<li>Have a passion for interacting with people</li>
	<li>Demonstrate a consistent positive attitude</li>
	<li>Have a sense of urgency when responding to our customer and co-worker requests</li>
	<li>Desire to Do the Right Thing and enjoy working in a team environment</li>
	<li>Can communicate in a positive and genuine way</li>
	<li>Are reliable</li>
	<li>Demonstrate a strong work ethic and take pride in a sense of accomplishment</li>
	<li>Process transactions accurately and efficiently</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0px <%=right_margin_split%>px 0px <%=left_margin_0%>px;">
It is important for individuals considering the Teller role to know and understand that every day will be a different day, therefore bringing an upbeat attitude that will exceed our customers&acute; expectations is vital.
<br><br>
<i>(Testimonial) &ldquo;You get to be the face of the bank.  You&acute;re the first person the customer sees, you get to meet the people and the customers and understand what they like to see in a banking center and understand what will make them stay with Bank of America rather than going to another bank.  So it just makes it a lot more personal and understand the way the banking center runs from the bottom up.&rdquo;</i>
<br><br>
<i>(Testimonial) &ldquo;Anytime you pretty much put on your name tag, your name badge, that&acute;s when you are considered on stage.  When you&acute;re on stage, you need to remember to do a lot of things.  You need to smile, always smile, always make eye contact.  You need to make sure you say the customer&acute;s name and things like that because that lets them know that they&acute;re not just a number, for example.  Because when you come into our banks, you don&acute;t take a number and have a seat.  We call you by your name and we let you know that we&acute;re here to help you and to be the face.  That means a lot to me to let people know that we are here to help them.&rdquo;</i>
<br><br>
Tellers are people who want to delight our customers and work to earn the customer&acute;s loyalty.  They work quickly and accurately even when things are busy.  A successful Teller at Bank of America will take the time to get to know our customers. 
<br><br>
<i>(Testimonial) &ldquo;As a customer, it is important for Bank of America tellers to take a personal interest in me, be friendly, demonstrate respect and appreciation. They should go out of their way to be helpful.  Take ownership to resolve issues and provide accurate answers to my questions.&rdquo;</i>
<br><br>
<b>Challenges</b>
<br><br>
There are high expectations of the Teller associates at Bank of America.  These expectations can present challenges that may make the job seem difficult at times.  It is very important that you consider these challenges because they are usually the things that make individuals decide whether or not they want to work as a Teller in the Banking Center environment.
<br><br>
Working on weekends and outside of normal business hours, Tellers work the normally scheduled hours of the banking center, which could include working after the banking center closes and also working weekends, depending on the location of the banking center.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Assisting upset customers</li>
	<li>Handling high volumes of cash</li>
	<li>Busy and stressful at times</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0px <%=right_margin_split%>px 0px <%=left_margin_0%>px;">
<i>(Testimonial)  &ldquo;It&acute;s difficult but you do your job.  You know, you greet them when you get in the door.  Ask them what the problem is.  You get it done.  I&acute;m a customer, too, you know.  I know what it is to wait in line, but as long as you do their job and get them in fast, you know, you&acute;re good.&rdquo; 
<br><br>
(Testimonial) &ldquo;It can be challenging to keep that smile all day and make sure you delight each and every customer that you come in contact with.  It is a lot of multitasking so if you are trying to get a transaction done really quickly and the customer is like, hey, wait, I need this or hey wait.  You just have to take that extra time out without getting frustrated about it.  You just make sure that each customer is happy that comes to your line and leaves your lilne.&rdquo;</i>
<br><br>
Tellers are also expected to meet or exceed goals on a consistent basis.  These goals include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Providing a high level of customer service with each customer every day</li>
	<li>Processing transactions and balancing a cash drawer accurately</li>
	<li>Offering and promoting Bank of America products and services to achieve referral goals.</li>
</ul>

Teller<br>
Thanks again Miss Parker.  As always, we appreciate your business.
<br><br>
Customer<br>
Thank you!  Oh - I forgot something.  When I checked my account online last week, I noticed a fee.
</p>
<br><br>
<p style="margin: 0px <%=right_margin_split%>px 0px <%=left_margin_0%>px; padding: 4px 6px; border: 1px solid #333333;">
Teller<br>
Oh no, unexpected fees can be frustrating.  What type of fee did you say it was?  
<br><br>
Customer<br>
I&acute;m not sure if it was a service charge or an overdraft fee.  I never had a fee before.
</p>
<br><br>
<p style="margin: 0px <%=right_margin_split%>px 0px <%=left_margin_0%>px; padding: 4px 6px; border: 1px solid #333333;">
Teller<br>
Let&acute;s try to figure this out.  What kind of balances have you been recently keeping in your account recently?  
<br><br>
Customer<br>
It&acute;s been going up and down lately.
</p>
<br><br>
<p style="margin: 0px <%=right_margin_split%>px 0px <%=left_margin_0%>px; padding: 4px 6px; border: 1px solid #333333;">
Teller<br>
Really?  So what&acute;s changed in your life to make it change?
<br><br>
Customer<br>
We&acute;ve been writing a lot of checks lately. My husband and I just had a baby.
</p>
<br><br>
<p style="margin: 0px <%=right_margin_split%>px 0px <%=left_margin_0%>px; padding: 4px 6px; border: 1px solid #333333;">
Teller<br>
Congratulations!  It sounds like your life has changed a bit.
<br><br>
Customer<br>
It has!
</p>
<br><br>
<p style="margin: 0px <%=right_margin_split%>px 0px <%=left_margin_0%>px; padding: 4px 6px; border: 1px solid #333333;">
Teller<br>
Well, let&acute;s go ahead and get you into the right account.  When was the last time you reviewed your account to make sure you were in the correct one?
<br><br>
Customer<br>
I can&acute;t even remember.
</p>
<br><br>
<p style="margin: 0px <%=right_margin_split%>px 0px <%=left_margin_0%>px; padding: 4px 6px; border: 1px solid #333333;">
Teller<br>
Well, with a new baby and all, we want to make sure you&acute;re in the correct account.  Our personal bankers are excellent at setting that up.  What&acute;s your schedule look like today?
<br><br>
Customer<br>
I think I have a few minutes.  I have to pick the baby up from the sitter and run a few errands.
</p>
<br><br>
<p style="margin: 0px <%=right_margin_split%>px 0px <%=left_margin_0%>px; padding: 4px 6px; border: 1px solid #333333;">
Teller<br>
We do have a personal banker available.  We&acute;ll go ahead and get you started with him.
<br><br>
Customer<br>
Great! Thank you!
</p>

<br>
<p style="margin: 0px <%=right_margin_split%>px 0px <%=left_margin_0%>px;">
 <i>(Testimonial) &ldquo;We have to do a lot of things.  We have a delight score.  We have a Teller referral score.  We have balancing where we have to make sure our cash drawer is balanced accurately.  If you score Teller delight and if you score all that, everything will come toward the end and you will succeed in all.&rdquo; </i>
<br><br>
As a Teller you can also expect to work in an environment that is always changing. New policies and procedures require the Teller to be flexible and learn to adapt to changes quickly.  These changes are important to the customer and to the success of the bank.  
<br><br>
 <i>(Testimonial) &ldquo;I think that change is always good and may not seem good at first when it first rolls out.  But as time goes on and you get to learn about the new information the new product you have and you learn about it, it&acute;s great.  It helps out the banking center and the associates and the customers as well.  Because if everything stays the same and nothing changes, where would we be?  We would always stay at point A instead of moving from point A to point B.&rdquo;</i>
<br><br>
<b>Rewards</b>
<br><br>
It&acute;s important that you understand that a Teller position is more than just challenging, it&acute;s also rewarding.

<br><br>
Associates find it very rewarding to educate customers on products and service information that could have a positive impact on their future.
<br><br>
