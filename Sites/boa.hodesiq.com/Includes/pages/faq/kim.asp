CFO senior leadership has invested in learning and developmental tools which allow all associates to explore growth opportunities.  Associates are ultimately responsible for managing their careers and should use the tools and resources available to assist in that effort.
<br><br>
Associates should also identify work values, personal values and current level of performance against the core CFO competencies.
<br><br>
Using this information, an associate can identify a career path, set a career goal and monitor progress along the way. 
<br><br>
Associates can enlist the efforts of formal and informal mentors to provide guidance and coaching as they maneuver through their career development plans.

Good performance deserves to be recognized and rewarded. We have a pay for performance environment where every associate has a specific development plan which charts the course for their annual performance measurement. Annual compensation is linked closely to the performance management process.
<br><br>
There is a talent planning process, which allows managers at all levels to share associate feedback and to provide stretch assignments for associates who are exceeding expectations in their current roles. 
<br><br>
Some of the rewards include Spirit Cards, Spirit Points, individual and team trophies, gift cards, team-building events and publications in finance communications.
<br><br>
The ultimate recognition is the award of excellence. Each our top performers are celebrated with a trip to a five star resort. Bank executives accompany the winners for a weekend of activities to recognize the group. 
<br><br>
We believe hard work should be rewarded and there are a variety of ways to demonstrate appreciation for a job well done.
