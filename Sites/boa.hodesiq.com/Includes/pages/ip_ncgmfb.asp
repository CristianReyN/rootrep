<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px 0px;">
The Mainframe Build College graduate program exists to help develop the next generation of mainframe technicians. Part of the program is a summer intern program which gives students hands-on mainframe experience in a summer job and provides a potential pathway to a full-time associate position within the Mainframe Build College graduate program.
<br><br>
The Bank of America Intern Program is designed to provide students with mainframe technology experience as it applies to banking. Students are given a true associate experience, as internships mirror full-time positions and include goal-setting and a formal review process. Interns are required to work 40-hour weeks for 10 -12 weeks between the months of May and September.  On-the-job training, mentoring relationships, and networking opportunities are provided for all interns.  
<br><br>
Interns will be assigned to a specific Mainframe technology team, or rotate among several teams during the internship.  Interns will be mentored by a senior technician and be exposed to the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Design, develop, implement and enhance transaction, database, communication and operating systems in support of business goals.</li>
	<li>Analyze, track, and troubleshoot performance of assigned system to ensure that all information processing and delivery requirements are met.</li>
	<li>Support the configuration, implementation, administration, monitoring and ongoing maintenance of assigned system.</li>
	<li>Provide project management support relating to process improvement in technology.</li>
	<li>Provide analytical support for data collection and measurements</li>
	<li>Participate in design, development and implementation of complex applications, often using new technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px 0px;">

</ul>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px 0px;">
