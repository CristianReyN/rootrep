<p style="margin: 0px;">With the My Work program, associates are provided the opportunity to work from a variety of locations, including a primary My Work center, other bank locations or from home instead of the traditional, dedicated cube or office. They are able to take advantage of a comprehensive provisioning policy that provides the tools and support necessary to work remotely and they also can be reimbursed for office expenses incurred as a flexible worker.

Recognizing the need for associates to maintain work, family and personal commitments, Bank of America offers a flexible work program.
<br><br>
My Work enables eligible associates to choose where and how to work where they can be most productive.
<br><br>
For many, My Work is not a new way of working.  But rather it formalizes one's ability to work flexibly.  Traditional office or work station is exchanged for a variety of work locations.  Whether it's from a My Work center, a drop-in location with one's team, on the road or from home, associates stay connected with their office, their team and their clients.
<br><br>
By reducing real estate and operating costs, this innovative solution can help businesses decrease costs.  And shareholders can be proud of our responsible approach to offering flexible work.
<br><br>
Major metropolitan areas with either a high pollution rate or high commuter time are targeted.  Reducing the associate commutes and developing My Work centers that are environmentally friendly provides the opportunity to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions across the country.
<br><br>
Working flexibly equates to less time commuting and more time on activities like working in the community, volunteering or spending time with the family.
<br><br>
My Work supports the Bank's culture which aligns compensation with results rather than for hours spent at a work space.
<br><br>
Thousands of eligible associates across the enterprise are already enrolled in this flexible work program.  They enjoy the freedom of being mobile when they need to and having space when they need it.  It's changing the way we work today.
<br><br>
The My Work program empowers associates, enhances communities and embraces personal connections with customers, clients and family.
<br><br>
Consider the possibilities.
