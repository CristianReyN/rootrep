>>(Text onscreen:  Bank of America/Supporting our Military)<br><br>
Cassi Chandler/Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Compliance Executive, Military Support & Assistance Group Executive Sponsor:   For more than 90 years, our company has supported the U.S. military because we recognize the sacrifices military and their families make every day to serve our country.  As a military daughter, wife and mother, I understand the tremendous value servicemen and women can bring to the workforce.   Bank of America actively recruits military reservists, veterans and spouses, because of the unique skills and experiences they bring to the table.
<br><br>
Kelvin Key joined our organization from the Wounded Warrior Project, which has been an important partner in our efforts to recruit disabled veterans.
<br><br>
Kelvin Key/Network Access Team, Global Technology & Operations:  I served 20 years of active duty in the Navy.  I knew that Bank of America was more than just a job.  It would be that second career that I was seeking.  It is important for companies to support military families because it’s rough enough when the service member’s out to sea.  So just knowing that the family members are well taken care of back home, it allows the service member to focus on the mission.
<br><br>
For this Navy veteran, Bank of America has provided a seamless transition from the military to the civilian workforce.
<br><br>
Geri Thomas/Global Diversity & Inclusion Executive:  The diverse perspectives our military employees bring to Bank of America helps us make opportunity possible for customers and clients around the world.  Our company is constantly changing to serve the needs of customers and thanks to their training, military employees are among the best at adapting to their environment, rallying their teams and continuing to get the job done.
<br><br>
Beth Hicks/Banking Center Manager, Consumer Banking:  I actually came into Bank of America to open a savings account because we had banked with Bank of America for several years.  And the manager on the spot recruited me.  And I started working for the bank actually two weeks later.  And I’ve been with the bank currently for ten years.
<br><br>
When I talked to them about my husband, in being in the military, they were actually excited about it and they said, you know, that wasn’t an issue.  How can you be a military spouse and work for Bank of America?  And I tell them my story about how the company has supported me and transferred me, and everybody is always amazed by it.  I can’t tell you how much gratitude I feel for all of the people when I would go to the regional leaders to let them know that my husband got a reassignment.  They were always so accepting and they helped me.  They sent emails, they always helped me find a position, and just so… everybody’s so caring and they still reach out to me from states ago and, you know, find out how I’m doing.
<br><br>
Geri:  Bank of America celebrates and honors our 5000 employees who have served or continue to serve our country.  They are an important part of the diverse and inclusive environment we strive to create.
<br><br>
Brian Love/Business Support Manager, Legacy Asset Servicing (Reservist who served in Afghanistan):  I’ve served my country since, probably 20 days after I graduated high school, so… It’s just something I think I’ve been drawn to… It’s something I like to do.  Bank of America has supported me in ways that you wouldn’t normally think or even expect from a company.  They’ve been very supportive on making sure everything was taken care of when I was… during the pre-mobilization process before I even left for my initial training, and then onward.  I’ve been in contact with people on a pretty regular basis, just keeping them up to date on things that are going on.
<br><br>
Geri:  So on behalf of Bank of America, I am honored to salute our military for their service to our country.  
<br><br>
Brian:  It’s nice to know that the company I work for is always, is looking out for us not just as a number but as an individual that has the same effects and interests in ensuring not just I’m okay, but that my whole family is taken care of as well.
<br><br>
Kelvin: It actually makes me feel proud to know that Bank of America not only talks the talk, but they actually walk the walk.
<br><br>
Beth:  I’m just so proud to be a Bank of America associate and I hope to be for years.
