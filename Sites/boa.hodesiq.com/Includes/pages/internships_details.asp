<H2 class="p" style="margin-top: 0px;"><b>Overview</b></H2>
<ul>
	<li>Interns generally work 40 hours per week for 10 to 12 weeks in a supportive learning environment complementing the day-to-day operations of a project or department</li>
	<li>Internship positions mirror the positions of full-time Bank of America Associates</li>
</ul>

<H2 class="p"><b>Internship benefits</b></H2>

<ul>
	<li><b>Compensation</b><br>We offer competitive compensation and benefits such as access to Associate Banking and two paid days off if you work more than 10 weeks. You are classified as a temporary associate for benefits purposes.</li>
    <li><b>Networking</b><br>You have the opportunity to meet and interact with senior executives at a variety of meetings and receptions. In addition, volunteer and social activities are offered for networking with peers.</li>
    <li><b>Professional development</b><br>Your work will be measurable and realistic, and allow you to stretch your abilities. To give you practice interacting with managers and demonstrating your business acumen, you'll present a summary of your project work to managers and peers at the end of your internship.</li>
    <li><b>Guidance</b><br>At the beginning of the summer, managers assist you in developing a performance plan to establish goals and objectives. These plans are reviewed during your end-of-summer performance evaluation. In addition, you're paired with a mentor for further guidance during your summer experience.</li>
