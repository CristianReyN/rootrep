<b>Ken Lewis, Chairman and CEO</b>
<br><br>
<i>&ldquo;Hello, I&#39;m Ken Lewis. Diversity and inclusion are core values at Bank of America for two reasons.&rdquo;</i>
<br><br>
<i>&ldquo;The first is basic fairness or &lsquo;doing the right thing.&rsquo; Being inclusive meritocracy means that once you&#39;re here, we don&#39;t care where you went to school, who your parents are or what race or gender you are.&rdquo;</i>
<br><br>
<i>&ldquo;The second reason is that to be competitive in diverse markets around the world, we need the best ideas and a range of perspectives on our team. That&#39;s why we believe diversity isn&#39;t only about traditional categories like race or gender. It&#39;s also about diversity of viewpoint, experience and inclusion. All these forms of diversity help us get to the right answers to win in the marketplace.&rdquo;</i>
<br><br>
<i>&ldquo;A diverse and inclusive culture means everybody gets a shot to perform and rewards are based on results. These values have made Bank of America a strong company throughout our history and will continue to make us strong in the future.&rdquo;</i>
<br><br>
From the beginning, our vision was clear: create a company founded upon opportunity for all, a place where diversity, inclusion, and equality are the foundation, a place where we can celebrate our differences and our similarities. No barriers, only opportunities.
<br><br>
Our history reflects that commitment. 15 of our 105 founding stockholders were women. As early as the 1800s, we managed trust accounts for the African American Teachers Union. The bank&#39;s first tellers were multilingual. And in the 1920&#39;s the bank named its first female Vice President.
<br><br>
Diversity and inclusion is not simply a legacy from our past. It is the core to who we are and where we are going.
<br><br>
<i>(Testimonial) &ldquo;As a military veteran my skills and experiences are embraced and help me to succeed at Bank of America. While the objectives and challenges may be different the principles are the same. Now I&#39;m working to see others have the same opportunity.&rdquo;</i>
<br><br>
Associates across the company are making a difference. Diverse associate networks encourage leadership and success. Line of business diversity business councils build skills, foster education, and achieve business goals through diversity and inclusion. Bank of America is a place where every associate has an opportunity.
<br><br>
<i>(Testimonial) &ldquo;At Bank of America, they see the person, not the disability. There is opportunity for all.&rdquo;</i>
<br><br>
<i>(Testimonial) &ldquo;At Bank of America it is more than just a job, it&#39;s a place where I can have a career, a real voice and give back to the community where I live and work.&rdquo;</i>
 <br><br>
Giving back to the community is core to the bank&#39;s culture. At Bank of America we are committed to making a positive difference in the diverse communities we serve through philanthropy, environmental and community development activities, support for the arts and volunteerism.
<br><br>
<i>(Testimonial) &ldquo;They not only talk the talk of community building and diversity, but they walk the walk.&rdquo;</i>
<br><br>
Through our community support we celebrate the opportunity to strengthen the ties that connect us all.
<br><br>
<i>(Testimonial) &ldquo;At Bank of America we embrace and value differences of thought and action creating a better world for today and for our future.&rdquo;</i>
<br><br>
And it is about being inclusive, not exclusive in everything we do. Ensuring we can meet our diverse and unique customer needs.
<br><br>
These efforts extend beyond associates, charitable giving, and customers. It includes doing business with diverse suppliers that provide Bank of America with quality products and services. Since 1990, Bank of America has increased spending with diverse suppliers each year.
<br><br>
We know that by promoting a better economic environment through our supplier diversity program that the very communities we serve will continue to thrive and grow stronger.
<br><br>
<i>(Testimonial) &ldquo;It is about opportunity and being valued as an organization. Bank of America embraces diversity and inclusion and lives it everyday.&rdquo;</i>
<br><br>
The opportunity - to ensure a culture where everyone is accepted and can contribute. Our 200-year legacy is a shining example of that. We truly aspire to make the future brighter - for our associates, customers, suppliers, shareholders, and for all the diverse communities we serve.
