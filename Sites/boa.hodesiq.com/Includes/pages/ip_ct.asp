<h2 class="h2" style="margin: 0px;">Overview</h2>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px 0px;">
The Corporate Treasury Associate Program (CTAP) is a 2-year Associate Development program, which aggressively moves associates through rotational assignments within Corporate Treasury. This rotational process helps associates develop a solid understanding of the core roles and responsibilities of Corporate Treasury, while developing a broad range of skills that are applicable throughout much of the corporation including all the various lines of business. CTAP associates participate in a variety of activities within Corporate Treasury and bank-wide, designed to foster teamwork, encourage networking and demonstrate Bank of America's vision and culture. The CTAP program builds relationships and coordinates events with other rotational programs within the bank to create a strong network of highly talented new associates.
<br><br>
As a CTAP associate, you will serve in roles that impact and analyze the company's financials, including:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Analyzing data and output from the bank's Asset/Liability Models to project the core earnings stream (net interest income), and understanding sensitivities to those earnings</li>
	<li>Analyzing and presenting key analysis of financial information used by senior management to make decisions that impact the company</li>
	<li>Assisting in the funding, capital analysis and execution of securitization transactions</li>
	<li>Trading Fed Funds and Eurodollar Time Deposits to provide short-term funding for the bank</li>
	<li>Forecasting and modeling cash flows to better project the bank's short-term liquidity needs</li>
	<li>Analyzing the bank's insurance needs, coverage and claims</li>
	<li>Contributing to the design, development and execution of processes or projects relating to corporate change initiatives</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px 0;">
The CTAP training curriculum is a multi-phase program that complements the hands-on experience associates develop in their rotational assignments. Some of the concepts covered during training are technical training, business acumen and behavioral courses. Each CTAP associate will be assigned an individual rotation and a mentor to help ensure growth and development. Associate development is critical to the success of Corporate Treasury, and executive leadership within the Corporate Treasury organization is committed to the success of our young associates.
<br><br>
Interns work for 10-12 weeks in Corporate Treasury roles that mirror the positions of full-time CTAP associates. In conjunction with those responsibilities, interns will also participate in CTAP functions including training sessions, informational lunches, networking events and community service opportunities. At the completion of the internship, eligible interns will be given the opportunity to interview for the Corporate Treasury Associate Program.
