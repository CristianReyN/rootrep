The Corporate Treasury Associate Program (CTAP) is a two-year Associate Development program, which aggressively moves associates through rotational assignments within Corporate Treasury. This rotational process helps associates develop a solid understanding of the core roles and responsibilities of Corporate Treasury, while developing a broad range of skills that are applicable throughout much of the corporation - including all the various Lines of Business. CTAP Associates participate in a variety of activities within Corporate Treasury and bank-wide, designed to foster teamwork, encourage networking and demonstrate Bank of America's vision and culture. The CTAP program builds relationships and coordinates events with other rotational programs within the Bank to create a strong network of highly talented new associates.

The CTAP training curriculum is a multi-phase program that complements the hands-on experience associates develop in their rotational assignments. Some of the concepts covered during training are:  technical training, business acumen and behavioral courses. Each CTAP Associate will be assigned an individual rotation and a mentor to help ensure growth and development. Associate development is critical to the success of Corporate Treasury, and Executive leadership within the Corporate Treasury organization is committed to the success of our young associates.
