New hires to Corporate Audit experience a multi-phase training process that begins with a robust 8-module, web-based training program that covers basic risk concepts and the Bank of America audit process. The web-based training is followed by a multi-day instructor-led training class where the associate gains hands-on experience practicing the audit process and tools. Following classroom training, the new auditor is placed on an audit team, with an experienced peer coach and manager who provide on-the-job coaching around the day-to-day execution of the audit process. In addition to the training and coaching for new associates, the department provides training opportunities for more experienced auditors, audit managers and directors to support their roles within the audit process throughout their careers.
