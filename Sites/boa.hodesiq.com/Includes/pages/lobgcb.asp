<b>Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America Merrill Lynch&#39;s Global Commercial Banking unit offers tailored solutions to a range of clients and industries</b>
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 12px;">
Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America Merrill Lynch is one of the world&#39;s largest financial institutions, serving individual consumers, small- and middle-market businesses and large corporations with a full range of banking, investing, asset management and other financial and risk management products and services.
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 12px;">
In this unprecedented economic environment, nearly every business has encountered challenges, many of which it has never before faced. Because of this reality, a trusted financial advisor is more important than ever before--an advisor with the experience to help clients find the right solution for current needs, anticipate emerging issues and, ultimately, position the business for growth as we move out of today&#39;s financial downturn into a more favorable marketplace.
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 12px;">
<b>Global Commercial Banking (GCB)</b> serves as that trusted advisor to more than 160,000 companies, ranging in size from $2.5 million to more than $2 billion in annual revenues.
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 12px;">
In addition to a broad array of general industry clients, GCB also offers customized and industry-tailored solutions to healthcare, large educational institutions, non-profits and government entities, among others. GCB&#39;s unique client coverage model enables it to provide clients seamless, integrated delivery of the bank&#39;s full capabilities through dedicated teams.
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 12px;">
GCB is excited about the expanded capabilities it can offer commercial clients as a result of Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America&#39;s recent merger with Merrill Lynch. These include enhanced capabilities in wealth and investment management, investment banking (equity and Mergers and Acquisitions), international and capital markets (public finance, etc.). Combined with an already strong ability to deliver credit and cash management solutions, GCB can now do "extraordinary things for our clients."
