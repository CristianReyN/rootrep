Bank of America provides a world-class orientation experience that immediately engages the hearts and minds of new associates from the first day of their employment.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
High-energy, cross-functional sessions are offered consistently across the company. Our goal is to have all new associates attend orientation within their first week of employment so as to provide a consistent experience for all new associates as well as to teach our new associates about the culture and values of Bank of America prior to interacting with our customers.
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
The orientation experience shares with the new associate:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Bank's rich heritage and legacy;</li>
	<li>Our core values;</li> 
	<li>The Bank of America Spirit;</li>
	<li>Our community contributions;</li>
	<li>Our purpose and how we are structured;</li>
	<li>Our commitment to customer delight;</li>
	<li>Our commitment to improving work processes via Six Sigma and related disciplines;</li>
	<li>The drivers of Associate success and satisfaction;</li>
	<li>Associate benefits and programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
After participating in the orientation experience, new associates will begin to understand what an amazing company of which they are now a part as well as identify how each of their jobs play a critical role in the overall success of the company. New associates will also have a sense of pride in how much Bank of America does to help its customers and clients realize their dreams. Most importantly, once an associate has attended our new associate orientation, he/she will immediately feel a part of the bigger picture and have a good understanding of how to make an immediate impact.
