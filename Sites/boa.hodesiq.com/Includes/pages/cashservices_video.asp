<b>Cash Vault Representative</b>
<br><br>
Welcome to Bank of America's Cash Vault Representative job preview.  This video provides job applicants a "behind the scenes" look at a Cash Vault Representative position and the job requirements necessary to be successful.
<br><br>
Bank of America has cash vaults in various locations throughout the country, and this is where the cash deposits and other transactions made at our Banking Centers and through our ATMs are processed and credited to our customers' accounts.  All cash deposits go to one of our vaults, where Cash Services Representatives count the cash, credit it to customer accounts, and prepare it for future distribution.
<br><br>
The basic duties of the Cash Vault Representative position include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Processing deposits and other transactions received at the vault location. These transactions must be processed in a timely and accurate manner, meeting strict deadlines with respect to how many transactions are completed over a given time period. The job requires a high level of attention to detail.</li>
	<li>Associates working in the cash vault must be flexible in their work hours, as the shift is not considered over until all the work has been completed. If the volume of cash and transactions coming into the vault is large, the associates' shift may be longer, while low volume days may result in a shorter shift.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0px <%=right_margin_split%>px 0px <%=left_margin_0%>px;">
Another basic duty of the position is handling large amounts of cash.  Because so much cash is present in the vault, strict compliance and security measures are enforced to protect our customers' assets and information.
<br><br>
The work environment is highly secured.  The nature of the work prohibits personal items in the work area, but associates are provided with lockers to store and secure their personal items while at work.  
<br><br>
Due to the extreme security measures required in the vault, it is also a windowless environment monitored by security cameras.  
<br><br>
Handling cash can be some what of a dirty job so all associates in the vault are provided with a smock to protect their clothing.
<br><br>
To be successful in the Cash Vault Representative position, associates must possess certain job skills including:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Experience handling cash and/or working a cash register.</li>
	<li>The ability to lift bags or trays of cash and other items weighing up to 50 pounds.</li>
	<li>The ability to write legibly.</li>
	<li>Strong basic math skills.</li>
	<li>Attention to detail</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0px <%=right_margin_split%>px 0px <%=left_margin_0%>px;">
Successful candidates must also be:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Flexible. Associates must be flexible about the work they are asked to do and the hours that they may be asked to work.</li>
	<li>Trustworthy. Because of the highly secure nature of the work and the vault environment, associates must be highly trustworthy.</li>
	<li>Responsible. Associates must take a sense of ownership about meeting timeliness and accuracy goals.</li>
	<li>Conscientious of polices and procedures. The nature of the Cash Vault Representative position requires strict adherence to all workplace policies and procedures.</li>
	<li>Thorough and accurate. Successful associates will demonstrate a high level of accuracy and thoroughness in completing their work assignments.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0px <%=right_margin_split%>px 0px <%=left_margin_0%>px;">
