>>Patricia Placencia, Mortgage Retail Lending Branch Manager:  My name is Patricia Placencia.<br>
I am the Consumer Real Estate Sales Manager for Bristol County.<br>
I have been with the bank for seven years now.<br>
I began my career as a Teller seven years ago in the consumer bank and later on transitioned to several different roles as a Personal Banker, a Small Business Specialist.<br>
Then had the exciting opportunity to come over to the real estate side of the world.<br>
In 2003, I was a Mortgage Loan Officer for about a year.<br>
Then I was promoted to Producing Sales Manager and just a few months ago, I was promoted to the Consumer Real Estate Sales Manager covering Rhode Island, Bristol County.<br>
I love interacting with my Mortgage Loan Officers.<br>
I love coaching them.<br>
I love watching them grow.<br>
I love watching them succeed and be, you know, top performers within the company.<br>
A typical day for me, since I have 16 new loan officers that have been with the company for less than a year, I spend a lot of my day coaching all day, every day and in conference calls, but a large portion of my time is spent coaching.<br>
I meet with my newhires on a weekly basis to go over any new products or enhancements to products.
I also invite business partners to talk a little bit about what they do and how they can help their customers, because it's all about deepening the relationship.<br>
So it's not just teaching them how to do a mortgage and how to close it.<br>
It's about bringing in that customer and deepening the relationship as a whole.<br>
So it's really important to me to introduce them to their partners throughout the bank, the Business Bank, Consumer Bank and Premier.<br>
I wanted to come work for Bank of America because I knew that I could come to one organization and grow within various roles in the organization, and it's evident by my career path.<br>
I started my role seven years ago as a parttime Teller and shortly thereafter, I was promoted to head Teller, promoted to a Personal Banker, Small Business Specialist and about three years ago, I was promoted over as a Mortgage Loan Officer in the Consumer Real Estate Division, and there's still more to come.<br>
It's a tremendous bank to work for.<br>
The culture is awesome.<br>
They listen to the voice of the associates here.<br>
It's all about the associate and the customer and the shareholder here.
