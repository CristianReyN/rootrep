The Bank of America Intern Program is designed to provide students with corporate experience in business banking policies and practices.  Students are given a true associate experience, as internships mirror full-time positions and include goal-setting and a formal review process.  Interns are required to work a minimum 40-hour week for 10 to 12 weeks between the months of May and September. On-the-job training, mentoring relationships and networking opportunities are provided for all interns.
<br><br>
Interns will participate in a formal program providing orientation and education to learn more about Bank of America's business, culture and values. Additionally, interns will participate in various networking and learning opportunities throughout the duration of the summer.

Interns who meet or exceed internship performance expectations may receive a full-time offer of employment to join Information Security Business Continuity, following their internships.
