This unique, 2-3 year program allows Analysts to rotate through our Global Markets Group Operations, while participating in three 9-12 month rotations within GMG Ops. In addition to developing cross-functional thinking and strong technical skills, Analysts also receive on-the-job training, participate in bi-monthly speaker seminars, and attend events with Analysts and associates from across GT&O. Potential rotations include key product areas (i.e. Equity Operations, Fixed Income, and FX Derivatives) and key functional areas (Accounting, Customer Service, Trade Support and Settlements). An analyst in Global Operations will provide technical and analytical operational support, including monitoring trade flow & balancing trades from the trading desk to our Back-Office systems for Buy/Sell transactions, and performing Trade Date comparison for Municipal and Corporate Bond trades.
