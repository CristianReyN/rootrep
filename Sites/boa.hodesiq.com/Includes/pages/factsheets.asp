<ul>
	<li>In 1847, our bank in St. Louis created a special banking day each week exclusively for women.</li>
	<li>Our bank in Los Angeles, Farmers and Merchants, catered to Chinese customers in the late 1800s.</li>
	<li>In the late 1800s, our predecessor bank in Washington, D.C., managed the famous Volta Bureau's trust account. The bureau serves as an instrument for the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf. Helen Keller performed the sod-breaking ceremony for the construction of the building.</li>
	<li>In the 1890s, our predecessor bank in Washington, D.C., managed the African American Teacher's Union Retirement Fund.</li>
	<li>The founding of Bank of Italy in 1904 (predecessor to Bank of America) was based on serving immigrants. The bank's first tellers were multilingual.</li>
	<li>In 1919, Bank of Italy's international foreign departments were formed and served Russian, Spanish, Greek and Italian customers.</li>
	<li>In the 1920s, the Bank of Italy's Women's Department named its first female manager and vice president in the country.</li>
	<li>Frederick Douglass had been one of the great leaders of the anti-slavery movement. But after his death, his home in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington, D.C., was falling into disrepair. Our bank in Washington, D.C., financed its restoration.</li>
