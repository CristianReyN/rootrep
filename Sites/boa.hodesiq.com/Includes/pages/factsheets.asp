<ul>
	<li>In 1847, our bank in St. Louis created a special banking day each week exclusively for women.</li>
	<li>The founding of Bank of Italy in 1904 (predecessor to Bank of America) was based on catering to immigrants. The bank&acute;s first tellers were multilingual.</li>
	<li>In 1919, Bank of Italy&acute;s international foreign departments were formed and served Russian, Spanish, Greek and Italian customers.</li>
	<li>In the 1920s, the Bank of Italy&acute;s Women&acute;s Department named its first female manager and vice president in the country.</li>
	<li>Our bank in Los Angeles, Farmers and Merchants, catered to Chinese customers in the late 1800s.</li>
	<li>In the late 1800s, our predecessor bank in Washington D.C. managed the famous Volta Bureau school for hearing-impaired students (attended by Helen Keller) trust account.</li>
	<li>In the 1890s, our predecessor bank in Washington D.C. managed the African American Teacher&acute;s Union Retirement Fund.</li>
	<li>Frederick Douglass had been one of the great leaders of the anti-slavery movement. But after his death, his home in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington, D.C. was falling into disrepair. So our bank in Washington D.C. financed its restoration.</li>
