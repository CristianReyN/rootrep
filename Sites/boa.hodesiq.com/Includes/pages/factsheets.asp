<ul>
	<li>In 1847, our bank in St. Louis created a special banking day each week exclusively for women.</li>
	<li>Our bank in Los Angeles, Farmers and Merchants, catered to Chinese customers in the late 1800s.</li>
	<li>In the late 1800s, our predecessor bank in Washington D.C. managed the famous Volta Bureau&#39;s trust account. The Bureau serves as an instrument for the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the Deaf. Hellen Keller performed the sod-breaking ceremony for the construction of the building.</li>
	<li>In the 1890s, our predecessor bank in Washington D.C. managed the African American Teacher&#39;s Union Retirement Fund.</li>
	<li>The founding of Bank of Italy in 1904 (predecessor to Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America) was based on catering to immigrants. The bank&#39;s first tellers were multilingual.</li>
	<li>In 1919, Bank of Italy&#39;s international foreign departments were formed and served Russian, Spanish, Greek and Italian customers.</li>
	<li>In the 1920s, the Bank of Italy&#39;s Women&#39;s Department named its first female manager and vice president in the country.</li>
	<li>Frederick Douglass had been one of the great leaders of the anti-slavery movement. But after his death, his home in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington, D.C. was falling into disrepair and our bank in Washington D.C. financed its restoration.</li>
