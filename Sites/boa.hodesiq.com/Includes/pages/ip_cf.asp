<h2 class="h2" style="margin: 0px;">Overview</h2>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px 0px;">
The FMAP is a 2-year associate development program, which aggressively moves FMAP associates through rotational assignments within Finance. This rotational process helps associates develop a solid knowledge base of the functional areas of the Finance Group and a broad range of skills. FMAP associates are encouraged to develop leadership skills by leading projects or committees, and participating in a variety of activities designed to foster teamwork, networking and an understanding of Bank of America's vision and culture.
<br><br>
The objective of the FMAP Intern Program is to provide students with the opportunity to expand upon their academic foundation specifically their technical skills, their knowledge of the industry and their familiarity with a corporate environment. This program will introduce interns to Bank of America, the Finance group and the Finance Management Associate Program. 
<br><br>

</p>
<ul>
	<li>Analyzing and reporting of on-going operations</li>

	<li>Developing models and performing financial analysis of business investments</li>

</ul>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px 0;">
In conjunction with these responsibilities, interns will also participate in training sessions, informational lunches, networking events and community service opportunities. These functions also provide exposure to Bank of America and the Finance Management Associate Program.
<br><br>
Performance appraisals are provided twice during the internship, at the mid-point and at the end. At the completion of the internship, eligible rising senior interns may be given the opportunity to interview for the Finance Management Associate Program.
