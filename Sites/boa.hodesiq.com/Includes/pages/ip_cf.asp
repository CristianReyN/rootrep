To deliver a best-in-class opportunity for Finance interns through experiential learning, training, and networking opportunities, the Finance Intern Program is designed to give associates the necessary experiences and exposure to determine their level of interest in the Finance Management Associate Program, while maximizing their contributions to Bank of America.
</p>

<h2 class="h2u" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;">Overview:</h2>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px 0px;">
The Finance Management Associate Program (FMAP) is a two-year associate development program, which aggressively moves Finance MAP Associates through rotational assignments within Finance. This rotational process helps associates develop a solid knowledge base of the functional areas of the Finance Group and a broad range of skills. Finance MAP Associates are encouraged to develop leadership skills by leading projects or committees, and participating in a variety of activities designed to foster teamwork, networking and an understanding of Bank of America's vision and culture.
<br><br>
The objective of the Finance MAP Intern program is to provide students with the opportunity to expand upon their academic foundation - specifically their technical skills, their knowledge of the industry and their familiarity with a corporate environment.  This program will introduce interns to Bank of America, the Finance group and the Finance Management Associate Program. 
<br><br>
Finance MAP Interns will serve in a Business or Corporate support capacity, performing one or more of the following roles:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Analyzing and reporting of on-going operations</li>
	<li>Forecasting financial and non-financial trends</li>
	<li>Developing models and performing financial analysis of business investments</li>
	<li>Supporting the Company's internal planning and management accounting functions</li>
	<li>Preparing external reports for shareholders and regulatory authorities</li>
	<li>Providing guidance on accounting policy issues and/or taxation issues</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px 0;">
In conjunction with these responsibilities, interns will also participate in training sessions, informational lunches, networking events and community service opportunities. These functions also provide exposure to Bank of America and the Finance Management Associate Program.
<br><br>
Performance appraisals are provided twice during the internship, at the mid-point and at the end. At the completion of the internship, eligible rising senior interns may be given the opportunity to interview for the Finance Management Associate Program. 
<br><br>
Bank of America hires up to 30 interns per year.  Interns receive a competitive hourly wage.  The program runs from late May to early August.
