    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>My current role in Equity Market Risk Group recently changed from Exotic 
      products side to flow business. I am still taking responsibilities in managing 
      risk, calculating VaR, generating scenarios/risk report and monitoring trading 
      positions on the Bank of America Exotic side. But as the migration progresses 
      and roles change, I am also quickly learning the systems and starting to 
      get involved in cash equity, single stock and vanilla index risk control/reporting, 
      and speaking to the desks to understand their position holdings. </p>
    <h4>What is the most challenging part of your job?</h4>
    <p>The most challenging part of the job is the increasingly important role 
      of market risk control and hence more responsibilities in demand in the 
      credit crunch. The current volatile economic environment requires much closer 
      watch on trading positions, keeping abreast with the market, and drawing 
      up scenarios analyses responding to any shocks quickly. These are all challenging 
      given the timing when I just joined the company as a junior analyst and 
      the fact that I need to properly understand the whole process and trading 
      portfolios as quickly as possible. </p>
    <h4>I remain here because...?</h4>
    <p>The very reason that I am attracted to work here is the people and current 
      leading status of Bank of America in the financial industry. People are 
      very talented, helpful and friendly. Managers are all providing good training 
      opportunities. The combined business between Bank of America and Merrill 
      Lynch stands at a much larger platform and hence offers a broader range 
      of opportunities for me to grow. </p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>Working in Bank of America provides you plenty of opportunities to pursue 
      especially after the merger with Merrill Lynch. You have to be willing to 
      learn all the time and adapting to changes because this is a company still 
      growing and expanding. You must also be someone determined to contribute 
      and work smart and hard. </p>
