                  <h1>Diversity and Inclusion</h1>
                  <p>Our commitment to diversity and inclusion comes right from the top: CEO and President Brian Moynihan leads our Global Diversity & Inclusion Council, which sets strategy and direction for the bank’s diversity initiatives and strengthens our commitment to a diverse and inclusive environment.</p>
                  <p>This senior support and commitment to diversity and inclusion continues in Europe and Emerging Markets (ex.: Asia) where the Regional Diversity & Inclusion Council has Jonathan Moulds, president, Europe, and Andrea Orcel, president, Emerging Markets, as its executive sponsors.</p>
                  <p>Our work environment draws on the strength of every employee to build an atmosphere of personal and professional growth. The following make our work environment unique:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li><a href="#AAG">Associate Affinity Groups</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#DP">Diverse Partnerships</a></li>

                  <div id="AAG"></div>
                  <h2 class="questions">Associate Affinity Groups</h2>
                  <p>Our Associate Affinity Groups are a vital part of the company’s diversity and inclusion efforts. The affinity groups are formal, bank-supported groups made up of employees who have a common identity along with others who support them. The groups meet periodically to network, mentor and encourage each other’s development, leadership and success. By giving voice to diverse constituencies within the company and to customers like themselves, the groups assist Bank of America Merrill Lynch with maintaining a fair and inclusive workplace. They also can enhance the bank’s efforts to bring exceptional, targeted products and services to our customers, clients and shareholders. </p>
                  <p>In Europe and Emerging Markets, we have Associate Affinity Groups covering:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Disability</li>
                  <li>Ethnicity</li>
                  <li>Gender</li>
                  <li>Sexual Orientation</li>
                  <li>Parents and Carers Network</li>
                  </ul>

                  <div id="DP"></div>
                  <h2 class="questions">Diverse Partnerships</h2>
                  <p>As well as internal expertise on diversity and inclusion, we look to draw on the support of external experts to ensure we are always at the cutting edge of good practice.</p>
                  <p>It’s also a way for us to publicly declare our commitment to equality and diversity.</p>
                  <p>We measure our success using the benchmarks and other tools these organisations provide and look to them to challenge and guide us.</p>
                  <p>We are members of:</p>

                  <h2 class="questions">EMEA Arts</h2>
                  <p>As a company doing business in more than 150 countries, and 
                    with almost 300,000 associates, Bank of America Merrill Lynch 
                    strives to promote greater cultural understanding worldwide 
                    in the firm belief that this will lead to improved economic 
                    opportunities.</p>
                  <p>Built on a foundation of responsible business practices and 
                    good corporate citizenship, our global commitment to the arts 
                    is demonstrated through our support of a broad range of programmes. 
                    These include sponsorship of travelling performances and special 
                    exhibitions, and turning the company’s art collection into 
                    a public resource through the Art in our Communities® programme. 
                    This has seen us lend complete exhibitions to museums and 
                    galleries free of charge. The Bank of America Foundation also

                    from grass roots arts education programmes to world-class 
                    institutions that play a role in creating a more culturally 
                    aware society.</p>
