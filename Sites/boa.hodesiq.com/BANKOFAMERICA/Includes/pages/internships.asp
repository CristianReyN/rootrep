An internship is more than a summer job - it's a great way to explore a career in financial services. You'll work alongside full-time associates as part of a team, developing the personal and professional skills that can give you a major advantage in the workplace.

<p style="margin: 12px 0px 6px 0px;">
Our 2006 internship application period has concluded. We post our summer internship opportunities from January through mid-February. We welcome you to check out our 2007 opportunities next January.
</p>

<p style="margin: 12px 0px 6px 0px;"><span class="body2">What interns do</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>Interns generally work forty hours per week for ten to twelve weeks, in a supportive learning environment supporting the day-to-day operations of a project or department.</li>
	<li>Internship positions mirror the positions of full-time Bank of America associates.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin: 12px 0px 6px 0px;"><span class="body2">Internship benefits</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>Compensation. Compensation for our internship positions is competitive. Other benefits include access to Associate Banking and two paid days off if the intern works more than 10 weeks. Interns are classified as temporary associates for benefits purposes.</li>
	<li>Networking. Interns have the opportunity to meet and interact with senior executives at a variety of meetings and receptions. In addition, volunteer and social activities are offered for networking with peers.</li>
	<li>Professional development. Your work will be measurable and realistic, and allow you to stretch your ability. To give you practice interacting with managers and demonstrating your business acumen, you'll present a summary of your project work to managers and peers at the end of your internship.</li>
	<li>Guidance. At the beginning of the summer, managers assist interns in developing a performance plan to establish goals and objectives. These plans are reviewed during the intern's end-of-summer performance evaluation. In addition, interns are paired with a mentor for further guidance during their summer experience.</li>
</ul>
