<p style="margin: 12px 0px 6px 0px;">
In 1847, 70 years before women won the right to vote, the newly founded Boatman's Bank (a Bank of America predecessor) set aside Fridays for banking by "the female community," so that women would feel comfortable doing the family banking while their husbands were at work. The first female customer, Mrs. Eliza Colton, marched in with a $100 deposit on a Saturday. From then on, women ignored the rules and banked every day. By the end of its first year, Boatmen's Bank had 186 customers, 22 of them women, thanks in part to its comfortable "ladies wing."</p>
