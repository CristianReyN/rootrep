    <h4>What is your current assignment and what are your principal responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>My principle responsibilities are the development and support of internal applications for the middle office in EMEA, the U.S. and Asia. I have recently worked on: developing a new application to enable each desk within the EMEA middle office to assess, review and track the level of control around each of its daily processes; upgrading an existing application that tracks out of office time across the global middle office to include new functionality requested by the business; and dealing with support calls on a variety of different applications.</p>
    <h4>What attracted you to work here?</h4>
    <p>My previous work experience had been in a very different industry and I really wanted to try something new. There is a great sense of teamwork here. Even when we are all working on individual projects, the whole team will discuss ideas and problems to help each other out; no one would be left to struggle on their own. </p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank of America Merrill Lynch?</h4>
    <p>Be honest and open minded, be proud of your achievements no matter how small. It’s not always about what you’ve done, but the way in which you have achieved it is important too. </p>
    <h4>Describe your summer internship experience and its value to you.</h4>
    <p>During my internship, I worked on developing new functionality for an internal web application belonging to one of the technology teams within Bank of America Merrill Lynch. At the time I had no previous application development experience, so I was given time for self training and loads of support from everyone in the team. I was definitely surprised by the amount I had learned and achieved by the end of the 10-week program. After completing the summer internship, I was offered a place on the graduate scheme.  The experience I gained during the internship was especially valuable to me when I started in my permanent role—not only in terms of technical knowledge but also in terms of knowledge about Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the financial services industry in general.</p>
