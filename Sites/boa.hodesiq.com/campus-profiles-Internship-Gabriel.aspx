     <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I am an analyst in the Mergers and Acquisitions Group in Hong Kong. My 
      main responsibilities include financial modeling, drafting presentations 
      and assisting in the day-to-day execution and running of deals. </p>
    <h4>What was the best project you worked on?</h4>
    <p>Advising a Japanese retail company on a cross-border acquisition of a Korean 
      target. I had the opportunity to take on more responsibilities and was in 
      charge of running the financial model and also worked closely with the senior 
      management of the client on areas like due diligence and valuation. </p>
    <h4>I remain at Bank of America because...?</h4>
    <p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch has a great franchise in Asia and would give 
      me the opportunity to work on many landmark transactions. The company also 
      has a great culture, as well as very motivated and intelligent leaders who 
      are genuinely interested in the employees' learning experience and overall 
      career development. </p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>Speak to as many people as possible about their experiences. This is so 
      that you will be equipped to make an informed decision as to which specific 
      division at Bank of America might be most aligned with your interests and 
      career plans. </p>
    <h4>If you participated in a summer intern program at Bank of America, describe 
      your experience and the value of your internship. </h4>
    <p>I was a summer analyst back in 2007, and I had the opportunity to work 
      on several live transactions, which gave me much insight into banking. The 
      program was very organized and I learned a lot during the course of the 
      ten weeks. On the whole, it was a very fruitful experience and it made me 
      decide to pursue investment banking as a full-time career. </p>
    <h4>What other activities do you enjoy outside of your work day?</h4>
    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and scuba diving. 
      I am also a food lover, therefore Hong Kong is excellent because there are 
      so many restaurants and private kitchens offering various types of cuisines.
