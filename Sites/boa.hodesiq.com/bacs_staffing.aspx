                <p>
                    At BA Continuum, we take career building very seriously - after all, an empowered
                    team working at the peak of its abilities is the core of our ability to deliver
                    to our clients. We believe that the three critical facilitators for career development
                    are: the associate, who functions as the driver; the associate&#8217;s manager,
                    who is the facilitator in the process; and the organization that works as the overall
                    enabler.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our career management framework is aligned with our value proposition and is based
                    on the philosophy of, &#8216;the right person for the right job&#8217;. It creates
                    an environment in which associate interests, aspirations and business needs function
                    in a mutually beneficial symbiosis.</p>
                <p>
                    Career management is driven by the long-term goal of improving skills in current
                    roles and becoming more marketable, while our career path options are flexible enough
                    to accommodate a wide range of associate interests and business imperatives.</p>
