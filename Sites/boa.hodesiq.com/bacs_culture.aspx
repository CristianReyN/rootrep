                    At BA Continuum, we treat each day as an opportunity to raise the bar and create
                    memorable experiences for associates, customers, communities and with each other.

                    &quot;Having spent almost three years with BA Continuum India, the one thing that stands out for me is the fact that this organization truly inculcates and fosters an EEE enabled culture: Exposure, Experience and Education.  I’ve been fortunate to have experienced a myriad of events ranging from acquisitions, economic slowdowns and strategic changes around how we operate as a company.  In addition, I have witnessed leadership changes leading to a renewed set of leadership behaviors, core values and operating model for our organization, impacting the way we operate as individual contributors as well as within our teams.  Together, these events have been refreshing and challenging at the same time, and have helped me grow on the professional and personal front.&quot;
