  <h2 class="questions">A winning platform</h2>
  <p>You're you. A supreme talent. A perfectionist in every way who embraces challenges at every turn and looks for recognition in every triumph.

A top-calibre graduate who knows what they want out of life and their career.</p>
<p>What makes you unique, what sets you apart from your peers will make Bank of America Merrill Lynch even stronger as a global financial institution. This is why we'll fully nurture and encourage you to fulfil your full potential. Our training will maximise your initiative. We'll support your ongoing development through our meritocratic ideals and our unparalleled mentoring. You'll find us open and accessible. We'll give you the freedom to shape your own destiny and the visibility to show exactly what you can do.</p>
<p>Our culture is a fusion of expectations to create a winning platform. A platform we're now ready to share with you.</p>
