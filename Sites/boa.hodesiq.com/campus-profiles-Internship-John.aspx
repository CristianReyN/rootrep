    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>Currently I am working to build a new team to provide valuations to our 
      institutional clients, consolidating the processes currently carried out 
      by various teams in the legacy Bank of America and Merrill Lynch organizations. 
      This is my first role as a leader of a team, so it's a new challenge for 
      me. Once we establish an initial process, my focus will shift to developing 
      and improving that process to allow us to best serve our clients. </p>
    <h4>What was the best deal/project you worked on?</h4>
    <p>For me it was building a global team in Collateral Management. I previously 
      worked on the London Collateral Management team. We operated independently 
      from our U.S. equivalent team. I was tasked with helping to establish a 
      global team, identifying best practices in both regions and combining them 
      to establish a single global organization. </p>
    <h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
    <p>I joined Bank of America in London when they were relatively small in Europe 
      but growing fast. I was attracted by the balance of small dynamic company 
      in London that was backed by one of the world's largest financial institutions. 
      Since that time the bank has grown to become a truly global institution 
      in both the distribution of its clients and the range of its product set. 
    </p>
    <h4>Who is the most influential person in your Bank of America career and 
      why?</h4>
    <p>I would say my first manager here at the bank; he taught me so much, involved 
      me in everything he worked on and gave me the chance to show what I was 
      capable of. I have used the knowledge I gained on a daily basis in every 
      role since, and I still keep in touch with him since he is now one of my 
      mentors. </p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>Do as much research as possible before deciding on the opportunity you 
      want to take. There are hundreds of different career paths here at Bank 
      of America so try and find something you will enjoy each day you come to 
      work. If you can find something you enjoy, success and opportunities will 
      follow. </p>
    <h4>If you participated in a summer intern program at Bank of America, describe 
      your experience and the value of your internship. </h4>
    <p>I really enjoyed my internship; not only did I learn a lot in my day-to-day 
      role, but Bank of America also provided many opportunities to meet people 
      from different parts of the business. These opportunities helped me to learn 
      about the industry as a whole, find the part of the organization that best 
      suited me and helped me to understand the culture of Bank of America. </p>
