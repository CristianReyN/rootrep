     <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I am an associate in the Equity Capital Markets group where I focus on 
      the origination effort in the Healthcare and Transportation spaces. I also 
      act as deal captain for all non-U.S. listed equity offerings that are sold 
      to institutional investors in the U.S.</p>
    <h4>What is the most challenging part of your job?</h4>
    <p>The most challenging part of my job is to consistently achieve a balanced 
      outcome in which both issuers and investors, who often have conflicting 
      interests, are satisfied with the end result.</p>
    <h4>I remain at Bank of America because&#133;?</h4>
    <p>In my opinion, the financial services platform that has been created here 
      at Bank of America Merrill Lynch is without rival.</p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America?</h4>
    <p>Know what you're looking for in a career before you pursue any opportunity 
      at Bank of America. People here are passionate about their work, so you 
      should feel comfortable that you'll be able to match that passion in whatever 
      role you may aspire to.</p>
    <h4>If you participated in a summer intern program at Bank of America, describe 
      your experience and the value of your internship.</h4>
    <p>I was a summer intern and the experience was one that I'll never forget. 
      Not only was I able to learn a great deal about the capital markets and 
      their role within an investment bank, I also learned how to multi-task, 
      prioritize various responsibilities and be accountable for all of my work. 
    </p>
    <h4>Add any other information about your background and experiences that you 
      want to share, especially activities outside of your work day including 
      volunteer work and hobbies.</h4>
    <p>Through work, I also became involved in the Student Sponsor Program of 
      New York City. I have sponsored a high school student from the Bronx for 
      the past three years and look forward to seeing him graduate in 2010.</p>
