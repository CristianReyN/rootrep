<p>Hi, I&#39;m Nicky. I&#39;m an International Corporate Treasury Associate.</p>

<p>We manage the bank&#39;s money so we are the bank&#39;s bank. I currently work on the International Currency Desk where I manage currencies such as Australian dollars, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars, New Zealand dollars and a few others. So basically it&#39;s my job to make sure, at the end of the day, we are square in all those currencies.</p>

<p>I like it when I&#39;ve got a million and one things going on and I&#39;m under pressure to get lots of things done. And if I get to the end of the day and I&#39;ve managed to achieve lots and I&#39;ve made money for the bank, then it&#39;s a good day.</p>
 
<p>Well, I wanted to work for one of the biggest and best banks in the world so obviously, I applied to Bank of America. And on the recruitment day, everyone was fantastically nice and everyone actually wanted to get to know me as a person and make sure that, you know, that I would fit in well at the bank.</p>

<p>In my first year of university, I was part of the officer training corps. And as part of that, you get to do a lot of adventure training. And one of the adventure training courses was a skydiving course, which I literally jumped at the chance to take part in. And I had two weeks skydiving in Germany, or I did about 15 jumps, solo jumps, and learnt how to back flip out of a plane at 15,000 feet. It was fantastic. And I think it helped to get me my job because it made me stand out in interview.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend a summer internship. I think it&#39;s a fantastic opportunity for students. They get to earn money in their summer, they get to get the experience working in a bank and decide whether or not it&#39;s for them. And if they&#39;re lucky and they work hard, then they&#39;re going to get a job for when they finish university which is just priceless, really.</p>

<p>The bank are extremely focused on your career and developing your career. You&#39;ll get a lot of assistance, you know, if you want to progress. Obviously, it&#39;s up to you, you have to work hard and you have to push for it. But there&#39;s always opportunities to expand your skill sets and move up if you want to do that.</p>

<p>Working and living in London is fantastic. I mean you&#39;ve got so much that London has to offer. But at the same time, I mean, I&#39;m a country girl so I live on sort of the outskirts of north London where I&#39;m close to Hampstead Heath. So I&#39;ve got the greenery if I want it, but at the same time, I&#39;m just sort of a train ride away from central London, which is fantastic.</p>
 
<p>Bank of America has a fantastic culture. They&#39;re very key on work-life balance, so if you want to work hard and you want to succeed it&#39;s a great bank to choose. But at the same time you don&#39;t have to give up your life, you don&#39;t have to give up your health and your sanity, so I would highly recommend it.</p>
