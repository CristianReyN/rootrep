            <p begin="10">Hi, Im Tanvi.  Im a technology analyst.  
</p>
<p begin="13">I work as an application developer within Global Rates and Currencies Technology at Bank of America.  
</p>
<p begin="19">On a day-to-day basis, Im involved in writing and maintaining software for financial risk management.  
</p>
<p begin="29">I would definitely recommend a summer internship at Bank of America.  If youre serious about working in the financial services 
</p>
<p begin="35">industry, Bank of America would be the best place to do your internship.  Within the nine weeks you will be exposed to several different sides of the bank 
</p>
<p begin="42">and at the end of it you would be in a very good position to make a decision.  
</p>
<p begin="50">Coming into work in the financial services industries means that I need to have a strong knowledge base of global markets and 
</p>
<p begin="57">investment banking.  So, combining that with learning about technology has been quite challenging.
</p>
<p begin="67">The bank will support all forms of career development activities that you want to explore, whether its learning about technology, 
</p>
<p begin="75">whether its learning about the business side of things, whether its soft skills youre interested in.  We have courses and affinity groups for each and every activity thats out there.
</p>
<p begin="85">Im involved in the Women in Technology and Operations and the Multicultural Leadership Network here at Bank of America.  We meet regularly for dinner, for networking.  
</p>
<p begin="94">And we talk about what everyones been up to in their stream of work and what are the new and interesting things theyre getting involved in. 
</p>
<p begin="105">You should come and work for Bank of America because of the cultural diversity here.  No matter which part of the world youre from there is a place for you here.  
</p>
<p begin="114">Your opinions will be heard.  You will be able to make your voice heard and you will be rewarded accordingly for your input.
