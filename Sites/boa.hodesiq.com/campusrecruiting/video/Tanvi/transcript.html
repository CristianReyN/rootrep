<p>Hi, I&#39;m Tanvi. I&#39;m a technology analyst.</p>

<p>I work as an application developer within Global Rates and Currencies Technology Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America. On a day-to-day basis, I&#39;m involved in writing and maintaining software for financial risk management.</p>

<p>I would definitely recommend a summer internship Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America. If you&#39;re serious about working in the financial services industry, Bank of America would be the best place to do your internship. Within the nine weeks you will be exposed to several different sides of the bank and at the end of it you would be in a very good position to make a decision.</p>

<p>Coming into work in the financial services industries means that I need to have a strong knowledge base of global markets and investment banking. So, combining that with learning about technology has been quite challenging.</p>

<p>The bank will support all forms of career development activities that you want to explore, whether it&#39;s learning about technology, whether it&#39;s learning about the business side of things, whether it&#39;s soft skills you&#39;re interested in. We have courses and affinity groups for each and every activity that&#39;s out there.</p>

<p>I&#39;m involved in the Women in Technology and Operations and the Multicultural Leadership Network here Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America. We meet regularly for dinner, for networking. And we talk about what everyone&#39;s been up to in their stream of work and what are the new and interesting things they&#39;re getting involved in.</p>

<p>You should come and work for Bank of America because of the cultural diversity here. No matter which part of the world you&#39;re from there is a place for you here. Your opinions will be heard. You will be able to make your voice heard and you will be rewarded accordingly for your input.</p>
