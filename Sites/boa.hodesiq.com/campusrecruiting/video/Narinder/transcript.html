<p>Hi, my name is Narinder, I&#39;m a Global Markets Associate.</p>

<p>Basically I work on a trading desk. It involves buying low and selling high in simple terms. And what we exactly trade is options, which is calls and puts.</p>

<p>What attracted me to the trading floor was the power I had, the power to take a call, to say "I have to do this", and then make money out of it. And it&#39;s a real-time result you get. If you take a call, the next thing you know you took the right call or wrong call.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so diverse. The team is so diverse in Bank of America. In my team we have French people, we have Americans, we have Indians, we have Chinese, we have people from Japan. It&#39;s such a diverse team and I like talking to different types of people, making new friends.</p>

<p>There are so many opportunities at the bank. I mean, if you want to grow in the field you are in to, there are so many opportunities. But if you wanted to learn something new, say if you are in Equities and you want to learn something in Fixed Income, the door is open for you. You can go to any trader or you can fix an appointment. You can go and you can you know. There are so many people I know who have changed their lines also. They went to Equities, they went to fixed income or they went to trading, they went to sales. So, the bank is full of opportunities if you want to go.</p>

<p>My summer internship was great. I mean, it was one of the best experiences. I learned so much. I made so many new friends. I knew what I had to do in my future, I mean, if I opted this career.</p>

<p>Hong Kong is a really nice place to live. I didn&#39;t want to go to New York, I did my internship there. I was working to be in Asia somewhere at this point of time. Because it&#39;s also closer to my home in India so I could take a four-hour flight back and I can go on weekends.</p>

<p>One strong reason I would say somebody should come to Bank of America Merrill Lynch is the responsibility they give. Right from the initial days you&#39;re given so much responsibility that you also feel so confident to do whatever you do, and that&#39;s how you learn. I mean, once you&#39;re responsible for something, once you know that you are answerable or accountable for something you are doing, you become much more responsible and that&#39;s how you grow.</p>
