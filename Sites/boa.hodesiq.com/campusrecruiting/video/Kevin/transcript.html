<p>My name is Kevin. I&#39;m in the Consumer MBA Program and currently I&#39;m a Product Manager for Emerging Payments.</p>
	
<p>On a day-to-day basis, product management is about influencing others and making sure that you see the bigger picture - that you have the vision and can articulate that and really get everyone on your team. I use my skills from finance, my skills from marketing, my skills from operations, on a daily basis. But the most important skills for me are organizational behavior and communication.</p>

 <p>I came to the bank through one of the different diversity hire channels. I came through Reaching Out, the LGBT MBA Conference, and I felt included from day one. I felt like I added something different to the bank and that I could be who I wanted to be and that the bank embraced that and sought me out because of it.</p>

<p>This is a bank that cares about its customers and it cares about its associates. And you need to show that you&#39;ve done a little research. Look at the core values; think about how we impact people on a daily basis.</p>

<p>But I would also say before your interview - know your story, know how you fit into Bank of America. I think I&#39;m not a traditional banking background - psychology and art history and I worked in a museum. But I work with people every day that are nontraditional backgrounds. There is no one right banker Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America. We want diversity.</p>

<p>Life is Charlotte is laid back but also exciting. So you really have an opportunity to get involved anywhere you want. I am the volunteer coordinator for our Carolinas LGBT Pride Network. I&#39;ve been able to get us out into the community, actually get the bank out interacting with people at food banks, at the AIDS Walk and at the upcoming Pride Festival.</p>

<p>Coming to Bank of America, it&#39;s not just a job. It&#39;s a great job. It&#39;s professional and personal development.</p>

<p>We have 60 million consumers out there that I can impact on a daily basis through product management, through working in this Consumer MBA Program. It&#39;s an amazing responsibility, and it makes me really identify with the work that I&#39;m doing.</p>
