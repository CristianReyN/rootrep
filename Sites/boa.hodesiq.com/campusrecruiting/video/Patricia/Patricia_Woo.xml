<p begin="10">Hi, I’m Patricia.  I’m an Investment Banking Analyst in the Energy and Power Team. 
</p>
<p begin="15">Investment banking is basically providing banking services for corporations.  So you would have advisory services such as for mergers and acquisitions, 
</p>
<p begin="26">as well you would provide funding opportunities in the form of debt or equity. 
</p>
<p begin="36">What I like best about my job is that it’s fast-paced.  It’s very interesting because every day you come into work not knowing exactly 
</p>
<p begin="43">what you’re going to be, you know, given to do on a daily basis.  You get to travel a lot.  You get to meet a lot of people from different companies and different places as well. 
</p>
<p begin="59">The bank provides a lot of career development opportunities. For example, last September I went to Singapore for a three-day analyst training program.  
</p>
<p begin="67">What the bank offered was financial modeling sessions which were extremely intensive as well.  Which really helped to reinforce the skills that you already have to use on a day-to-day basis. 
</p>
<p begin="83">I think Hong Kong is definitely one of the best places that you can work because you’re close to Southeast Asia and also you’re close to China.  
</p>
<p begin="91">You know, these are the most happening economies of the world right now.
</p>
<p begin="95">When I get time off what I enjoy doing is yoga.  In particular I really enjoy Bikram yoga because you go into a hot room and you get to sweat a lot and also you get to do, you know, 
</p>
<p begin="105">a lot of really intense stretches.  And at the same time, you know, after you’re done it’s really calming as well. 
</p>
<p begin="118">I think at Bank of America Merrill Lynch you definitely get to meet people who are fun, who are very hardworking, very good at what they do, 
</p>
<p begin="126">but at the same time they also care about your career development.
