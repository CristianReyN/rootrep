<p begin="10">Hi, I’m Patricia.  I’m an Investment Banking Analyst in the Energy and Power Team. 
</p>
<p begin="15">Investment banking is basically providing banking services for corporations.   
</p>
<p begin="21" end="30">So you would have advisory services such as for mergers and acquisitions, as well we provide funding opportunities in the form of debt or equity. 
</p>
<p begin="35">What I like best about my job is that it’s fast-paced.  It’s very interesting because every day you come into work not knowing exactly what you’re going to be, you know, given to do on a daily basis.  
</p>
<p begin="47" end="54">You get to travel a lot.  You get to meet a lot of people from different companies and different places as well. 
</p>
<p begin="58">The bank provides a lot of career development opportunities. For example, last September I went to Singapore for a three-day analyst training program.  
</p>
<p begin="67" end="79">What the bank offered was financial modeling sessions which were extremely intensive as well.  Which really helped to reinforce the skills that you already have to use on a day-to-day basis. 
</p>
<p begin="83">I think Hong Kong is definitely one of the best places that you can work because you’re close to Southeast Asia and also you’re close to China.  You know, these are the most happening economies of the world right now.
</p>
<p begin="95" end="112">When I get time off what I enjoy doing is yoga.  In particular I really enjoy Bikram yoga because you go into a hot room and you get to sweat a lot and also you get to do, you know, a lot of really intense stretches. And at the same time, you know, after you’re done it’s really calming as well. 
</p>
<p begin="118" end="130">I think at Bank of America Merrill Lynch you definitely get to meet people who are fun, who are very hardworking, very good at what they do, but at the same time they also care about your career development.
