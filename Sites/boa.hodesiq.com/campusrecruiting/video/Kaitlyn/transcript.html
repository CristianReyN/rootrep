<p>Hi. My name is Kaitlyn. I&#39;m a first-year analyst in Equity Specialist Sales.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m essentially a stockbroker to institutional clients. And those clients are hedge funds, mutual funds and pension fund managers. So we provide our clients with both stocks that they can physically buy and sell, but also the research ideas behind those stocks.</p>
	
<p>When I come in in the morning, the most important part of our job is getting information to our clients before the market opens. So I like to get in early, read our research and help prepare it for our clients so that they can be prepared when they get in, in the morning.</p>

<p>The most challenging part of my job, I&#39;d have to say, is pitching stocks to clients. Some of my clients are very sophisticated. They&#39;ve been in this business for longer than I&#39;ve been alive. And I have to gather the confidence and the industry knowledge to be able to pitch them the stock. So while it is the most difficult part of my job, it&#39;s also the most exciting.</p>

<p>I interned for the bank in the summer of 2009. It was great because of a rotational program. I got to spend time in three very different parts of the bank from equity sales to structured products trading to short-term fixed income.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised that from an early stage the bank gives you a lot of responsibility. For my day-to-day work, I&#39;m already involved in real client interaction and revenue generating activities.</p>

<p>The first time I walked into a Bank of America Merrill Lynch trading floor, there was something different about it. I had been on other trading floors before and I really think the difference had to do with the people. I could see a sense of enthusiasm and passion in these people and when I started meeting them, talking to them, that same enthusiasm was instantly instilled in me.</p>

<p>The team atmosphere is something that I really strive in. Whether it&#39;s my competitive nature or just team or leadership abilities, the team-work part was a huge aspect of why I came to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>

 <p>I absolutely love living and working in New York. I&#39;m going on my five year mark living in the city. I mean, as most people would say, there&#39;s always something going on. There&#39;s always people around, whether you want to go to a small coffee shop, you want to go to a big club, everything that you want to do is offered in New York City.</p>

<p>I really think the best piece of advice I give is come in and meet us. I think if you come in and meet the people that you might be working with, you&#39;ll really see if that&#39;s somewhere where you want to work. And when I walked into the Bank of America trading floor, I instantly just felt something. I wanted to work here.</p>
