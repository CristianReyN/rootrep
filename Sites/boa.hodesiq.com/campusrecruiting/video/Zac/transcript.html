<p>Hi. I&#39;m Zac. I&#39;m a treasury solutions analyst here with the Commercial Real Estate Banking group Bank&nbsp;of&nbsp;America.</p>

<p>Here at the bank in the Commercial Real Estate Banking group, we offer two products to our clients. We offer a credit product that allows clients to buy property. And then, what I do is when we work with those credit clients to manage their cash and their liquidity for all commercial real estate banking.</p>

<p>The reason it&#39;s exciting to work here at the bank for me is I had always been focused on real estate throughout my undergraduate career. Here at the bank, I&#39;m able to look at that from a completely new perspective and develop new skills and ideas that I have never really had before in my real estate background.</p>

<p>The people that have helped me along the way here at the bank were my manager and my mentor while I was first in the analyst program. They took the time to learn who I am as a person and that really helped me develop my skills.</p>

<p>The group atmosphere here at the bank is great. I really developed close relationships with all of the analysts in my program. And even though we&#39;re out of the program now, I still talk to them to this day to develop not just my knowledge but friendships and networking opportunities as well.</p>

<p>Bank of America is a great place to give someone right out of undergraduate an opportunity to grow into a career and not just a job. The bank, in general, really provides opportunities for all kinds of individuals in all facets of business to grow and develop skill sets needed to not just function in a job environment, but develop and build a successful career as well.</p>
	
<p>The advice that I could give to an undergraduate interested in the commercial real estate banking program is to think of this as a way to develop your career. Not just as a job out of college. Because that&#39;s what this opportunity is. It&#39;s a very unique, exciting opportunity that gives you ways to grow and succeed in commercial real estate that not a lot of other places are able to do.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so many different opportunities and jobs that you can take here at the bank that it&#39;s really the sky is the limit.</p>
