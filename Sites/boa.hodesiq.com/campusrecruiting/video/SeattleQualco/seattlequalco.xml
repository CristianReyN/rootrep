<p begin="00" end="09">Here at the Qualco Bio Gas Farms we produce enough electricity each day to run close to three-hundred homes.
</p>
<p begin="11" end="16">The Bio Gas farm came forward as an idea amongst Tulalip tribes and the farmers.
</p>
<p begin="17">I’m Andy Werkhoven. I and my brother Jim are partners with 
</p>
<p begin="21">the Tulalip tribe in a non-profit company called Qualco. Qualco produces energy with our manure and all kinds of other yucky stuff. 
</p>
<p begin="31">The challenge was believing that this project could happen. We needed help. We were looking for a relationship and Bank of America was the first to step up to the plate. 
</p>
<p begin="42">Not only do we have a business relationship but we have a community relationship. The Bank is working with us to make a better community.
</p>
<p begin="49">To me, it’s testament that they have vision in the idea of clean, renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, sustainable fish and wildlife. 
</p>
<p begin="58" end="65">Those are things that are important to us but obviously had to be important to Bank of America also.
