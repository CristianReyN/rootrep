<p><i>(Mel Sheldon)</i> "Here at the Qualco Bio Gas Farms we produce enough electricity each day to run close to three-hundred homes."</p>

<p><b>Mel Sheldon, Chairman, Tulalip Tribes</b></p>

<p><i>(Mel Sheldon)</i> "The Bio Gas farm came forward as an idea amongst Tulalip tribes and the farmers."</p>

<p><b>Andy Werkhoven, Partner, Qualco Energy Corp</b></p>

<p><i>(Andy Werkhoven)</i> "I'm Andy Werkhoven. I and my brother Jim are partners with the Tulalip tribe in a non-profit company called Qualco. Qualco produces energy with our manure and all kinds of other yucky stuff. "</p>

<p><i>(Mel Sheldon)</i> "The challenge was believing that this project could happen. We needed help. We were looking for a relationship and Bank of America was the first to step up to the plate. Not only do we have a business relationship but we have a community relationship. The Bank is working with us to make a better community."</p>

<p><i>(Andy Werkhoven)</i> "To me, it's testament that they have vision in the idea of clean, renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, sustainable fish and wildlife. Those are things that are important to us but obviously had to be important to Bank of America also."</p>

<p>Every day, Bank of America helps support emerging technologies and innovative non-profits like Qualco.</p>

<p>It's another example of how our giving, lending and investing are helping set opportunities in motion.</p>
