    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I work as an associate in the Healthcare Investment Banking Group in New 
      York, and my responsibilities include financial and market analyses. My 
      group advises clients on capital raising, including debt and equity products, 
      as well as merger &amp; acquisitions advisory services. Additionally, I am responsible 
      for day-to-day execution on live transactions. </p>
    <h4>What was the best deal/project you worked on?</h4>
    <p>I worked on a recently announced multibillion dollar sell-side. This was 
      a great experience for me as I was involved on this transaction since pitching 
      the idea to the client almost a year before it was announced. I was able 
      to contribute to the process and had very close interaction with our client 
      on a day-to-day basis. </p>
    <h4>What is the best thing about living and working in your location? </h4>
    <p>Working in investment banking and living in New York is a great combination. 
      New York is the financial capital of the world, and being here at the beginning 
      of my career allows me to learn and be involved in transactions that include 
      all or most of the products that investment banking offers. This will give 
      me relevant experience anywhere in the world. </p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>Be very well prepared for your interview. It might sound obvious, but sometimes 
      it's not. Know why are you here and, more importantly, why you want to join 
      Bank of America. You will have the opportunity to ask about the company, 
      but you have to do your own homework getting to know the firm and why would 
      you consider it as a potential opportunity. </p>
    <h4>If you participated in a summer intern program at Bank of America, describe 
      your experience and the value of your internship. </h4>
    <p>I did my summer internship at Bank of America in the summer of 2006. It 
      was a great experience for me, so much that I decided to come back. The 
      generalist program in Investment Banking provides you the opportunity to 
      get to know different groups. This is of great value as you can learn from 
      both the dynamic of the group as well as from the industry; then you can 
      decide among different groups and determine your best fit. </p>
