                  <p>Bank of America's commitment to corporate social responsibility 
                    (CSR) is a strategy for improving the communities served by 
                    the company as well as the long-term health and success of 
                    the business.</p>
                  <h2 class="questions">Bank of America Merrill Lynch Corporate Philanthropy</h2>
                  <p>Building on a long-standing tradition of investing in the 
                    communities it serves, last year Bank of America embarked 
                    on a ten-year goal to donate US$2 billion to non-profit organisations 
                    engaged in improving the health and vitality of their neighbourhoods. 
                    The company’s associate volunteers contributed more than 800,000

                    world-wide. For more information about Bank of America Corporate
