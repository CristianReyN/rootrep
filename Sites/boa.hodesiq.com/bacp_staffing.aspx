                <p>
                   At BA Continuum, we take career building very seriously - after all, an empowered team, working at the peak of its abilities is the core of our ability to deliver to our clients. We believe that the three critical facilitators for career development are: the associate, who functions as the driver; the associate’s manager, who is the facilitator in the process; and the organization that works as the overall enabler. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our career management framework is aligned with our value proposition and is based on the philosophy of, ‘the right person for the right job’. It creates an environment in which associate interests, aspirations and business needs function in a mutually beneficial symbiosis.</p>
                <p>
                   Career management is driven by the long-term goal of improving skills in current roles and becoming more marketable, while our career path options are flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of associate interests and business imperatives.</p>
                <p>
                    While there may be some differences in the BA Continuum staffing process depending on which Line of Business or Business Unit you are considering, the key elements remain the same.</p>
                <p>
                Candidates should search and apply for the positions in which they are interested, possess the skills, and match the minimum requirements of the job.

                <p>

                <p>
                The interview/screening process varies with each opportunity. The recruiter will communicate the process and interview timeline for the position. 
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
