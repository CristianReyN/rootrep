    <h4>What are your principle responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I am an Associate on the Corporate Finance team in Investment Banking. I work on a wide range of activities including understanding companies’ balance sheets and optimal financing for our clients, executing financing transaction and evaluating acquisition financing. I am responsible for completing the analysis of different financing solutions, explaining these options to clients to determine the best solution and then executing these transactions.</p>
    <h4>What was the best deal or project you worked on?  Describe your role.</h4>
    <p>This past year, I worked on the Initial Public Offering of a Norwegian company. I had several roles on the project, but primarily I managed the execution of the project to ensure that our team was coordinated with the client, the other banks and lawyers. Additionally, I had a significant role in the drafting of the marketing and legal documents. It involved me working with lawyers and key members of the client management team, including spending time in Oslo in drafting meetings. In addition to being an interesting project, I enjoyed it because I had a lot of responsibility and the deal team looked to me for answers and to ensure that the process ran smoothly.</p>
    <h4>What attracted you to work here?</h4>
    <p>When I was evaluating my options at business school, I wanted to work on the most meaningful deals in the market while working with individuals who have a great attitude about their work and respect for each other. I found that to be the case here at Bank of America Merrill Lynch during the recruiting process, the summer internship and now as a full-time Associate.</p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank of America Merrill Lynch? </h4>
    <p>It is very important to consider what role and in which group you would like to work. There is enormous diversity of jobs at the bank, and those who enjoy their jobs the most are those that find jobs that fit their goals and strengths.</p>
    <h4>Describe your summer internship experience and its value to you.</h4>
    <p>The internship was extremely useful. It helped me to determine which group I wanted to join full-time and helped me to understand how to be successful on the job.</p>
