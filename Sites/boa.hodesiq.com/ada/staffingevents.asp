<p class="H3"><b>Do you have a question?&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class="s" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>1) Do I have to attend a school full-time to attend a school event?</b></p>
<p class="s" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><i>No, however most career centers require students, who participate in on-campus events, to be currently enrolled or alumni who have graduated within the last 12 months.</i></p>

<p class="s" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>2) Are these all the events Bank of America attends?</b></p>
<p class="s" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><i>Yes, however there may be last minute additions or changes that occur which are not updated. Please check with your Career Center for the most up to date list.</i></p>

<p class="s" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>3) How can I invite Bank of America to attend my school?</b></p>
<p class="s" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><i>We use a number of factors to determine our campus recruiting calendar. These factors are evaluated on an annual basis to determine the final list of schools that best meet our needs for each recruiting season.</i></p>

<p class="s" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>4) What if my school isn't listed, can I attend any event?</b></p>
<p class="s" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><i>Unfortunately, no. Most career centers require students who participate in on-campus activities and events to be enrolled as a student.  We recommend that you review our college recruiting page to apply for employment opportunities.</i></p>

<p class="s" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>5) Do I get one-on-one time with a Bank of America recruiter at events?</b></p>
<p class="s" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><i>Yes, but in some cases that time depends on the type of event. Some events have limited time for one-on-one interaction because of the size and scope.</i></p>

<p class="s" style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><b>6) What if I missed an event at my school?</b></p>
<p class="s" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><i>If you happen to miss an event, we recommend you check with your career center to obtain contact information of recruiters who visited your college.</i></p>
