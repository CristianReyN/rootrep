    <h4>What is the best thing about living and working in your location?</h4>
    <p>Having worked in both a regional branch and at the headquarters in New 
      York, I feel that both have their pros and cons. Being in New York offers 
      unparalleled opportunities to stay immersed in the flow of information and 
      provides significant opportunities to stay visible with clients. From a 
      personal life standpoint, New York offers activities for every interest 
      at almost all hours of the day. The cultural and dining options are almost 
      limitless. </p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>In addition to the day-to-day responsibilities within different groups 
      and different firms, always keep in mind the people you will be working 
      with. Personalities can vary from group to group, and your relationship 
      with coworkers will have a significant impact on your overall experience 
      in any role. </p>
    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I'm in Fixed Income Research covering U.S. banks, broker/dealers and finance 
      companies. In addition to my capacity as a junior analyst covering these 
      sectors, I am the primary analyst covering credit card companies. On a daily 
      basis, I am in contact with the investment grade trading desk, institutional 
      investors and, more recently, members of Merrill Lynch's Financial Advisor 
      network. The interaction ranges from expressing a basic credit view to pitching 
      relative value trade ideas. </p>
    <h4>What is the most challenging part of your job?</h4>
    <p>Credit research works in very lean teams, with only a Managing Director 
      and me covering companies that account for a very significant portion of 
      outstanding investment grade debt. The small teams led to significant exposure 
      to clients and other members of the firm very early in my career. While 
      such situations can be overwhelming early in a career, they provide an opportunity 
      to prove your skills to more senior members of the firm, which can help 
      career advancement. </p>
