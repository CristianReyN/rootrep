    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I am currently working in the Associate Relations (AR) team working on 
      cases such as Grievances, Disciplinaries, as well as other ER-related projects. 
    </p>
    <h4>What is the most challenging aspect of your job?</h4>
    <p>The most challenging part of my role would be the fact that each day is 
      unpredictable. Each day brings new challenges and priorities that can change 
      by the minute, but this aspect of the role is also the most rewarding. I 
      enjoy the challenges and diverse issues that I may have to deal with from 
      one day to the next and am continuously learning more about the roles within 
      Human Resources (HR) and the businesses we look after. </p>
    <h4>I remain here because...?</h4>
    <p>The incredible experience I have gained and relationships I have built 
      have made my time here both rewarding and fun. The rotational programme 
      is giving me a rich and challenging experience, which will serve as a solid 
      foundation for any career in HR. </p>
    <h4>What is the best thing about living and working in your location?</h4>
    <p>I have lived in London my whole life and really love working in the city. 
      London is comprised of various cultures, fascinating people, a unique history, 
      a lively social scene and an interesting, diverse working environment. </p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>Working in HR at Bank of America is fast paced and challenging; be prepared 
      to work hard and learn fast. Aim to build strong relationships and nurture 
      these as you work through your rotations and always feel confident to ask 
      questions. </p>
