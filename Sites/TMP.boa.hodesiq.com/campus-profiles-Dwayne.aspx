    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>Try and find an area and opportunity that you like. The job takes a lot 
      of time, so it would be good if it was spent doing something you enjoy. 
    </p>
    <h4>Describe your experience as an intern at Bank of America.</h4>
    <p>I did an internship in 2007. It was an eye opening experience as I got 
      to see the company from different angles and get a good understanding of 
      how things work. Many opportunities were presented to us as interns to hear 
      what other teams do and upcoming projects that would begin soon. I also 
      got to build bridges with many people, which makes the transition to full-time 
      employment that much easier. </p>
    <h4>What other activities do you enjoy outside of your work day?</h4>
    <p>Although I have had to reduce the frequency since starting my full-time 
      role at the company, I very much look forward to and enjoy DJing various 
      styles of music. </p>
    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>My current assignment is to ensure the data network in EMEA is in great 
      condition. My principal responsibilities include: maintaining a stable environment 
      to support the business; managing vendors that provide the company with 
      various services such as data circuits and network appliances; Second/Third 
      line support for network-related issues that covers the entire infrastructure; 
      and quick and accurate troubleshooting to restore connectivity if an outage/service 
      degradation occurs. </p>
    <h4>What was the best deal/project you worked on?</h4>
    <p>The best project I've worked on so far is planning the powerdown of the 
      entire London datacenter. I have to liaise with all the other teams and 
      help to coordinate the activities. This is particularly challenging since 
      the network is the glue that binds the entire infrastructure together. Everything 
      will depend on the network connectivity so any issues will have to be addressed 
      promptly and clinically. </p>
    <h4>I remain here because...?</h4>
    <p>I thoroughly enjoy my job, I like the variety of my daily tasks and I feel 
      am given opportunity to grow. </p>
