                    manifested itself in a number of initiatives.</p>

                  <h3>EMEA Arts</h3>
                  <p>As a company doing business in more than 150 countries, and 
                    with almost 300,000 associates, Bank of America Merrill Lynch 
                    strives to promote greater cultural understanding worldwide 
                    in the firm belief that this will lead to improved economic 
                    opportunities.</p>
                  <p>Built on a foundation of responsible business practices and 
                    good corporate citizenship, our global commitment to the arts 
                    is demonstrated through our support of a broad range of programmes. 
                    These include sponsorship of travelling performances and special 
                    exhibitions, and turning the company’s art collection into 
                    a public resource through the Art in our Communities® programme. 
                    This has seen us lend complete exhibitions to museums and 
                    galleries free of charge. The Bank of America Foundation also 
                    provides philanthropic support to a range of arts organisations, 
                    from grass roots arts education programmes to world-class 
                    institutions that play a role in creating a more culturally 
                    aware society.</p>
