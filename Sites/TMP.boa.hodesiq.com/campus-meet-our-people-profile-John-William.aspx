    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I am currently in the Global Wealth and Investment Management (GWIM) Graduate 
      Programme, and my focus is on learning the knowledge and skills to become 
      a financial adviser. Having spent the last six months learning about financial 
      products and their suitability for different types of private clients, I 
      am now working with financial advisers and getting hands-on experience working 
      with and assisting clients, so that I can eventually manage my own clients. 
    </p>
    <h4>What is the most challenging part of your job?</h4>
    <p>The biggest challenge is actually the part of my job which I enjoy the 
      most. No two private clients are the same and the solutions they require 
      are constantly changing and evolving. The challenge is to stay up to date 
      with the latest product, regulatory, and economic changes so that the solutions 
      provided are the best and the most suitable. </p>
    <h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
    <p>The bank has a long history of providing excellent training to the graduates 
      it takes and has always seen the value of developing talent. As someone 
      who did not have a background in finance or economics, I was really keen 
      to join a firm which takes on people based on what they have the potential 
      to achieve with good training. </p>
    <h4>What is the best thing about living and working in your location?</h4>
    <p>London remains one of the most influential and innovative financial centres 
      in the world, and many markets look to see what London is doing and often 
      replicate that. Whether it's a new type of product or a new piece of legislation, 
      you really are connected to the latest developments in finance and in a 
      great position to react. </p>
    <h4>Describe your experience and the value of your experience in the summer 
      intern programme. </h4>
    <p>I took part in the GWIM 2007 summer internship programme. Having had only 
      a basic knowledge of wealth management and finance, this provided me with 
      an opportunity to ask simple questions and to see the various departments 
      that make up wealth management. This meant I was able to make a far more 
      informed decision when choosing where I wanted to work, and also meant that 
      I could hit the ground running when I joined a year later as a graduate.
