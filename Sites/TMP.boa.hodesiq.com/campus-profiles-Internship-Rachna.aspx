    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
<p>I currently work in Credit Derivatives Strategy, which is a global team covering the
European and North American credit derivatives markets. Our main responsibility
is to generate timely, market-focused research for internal and external clients.
The research can be in the form of quick snapshots of market moves
or in-depth qualitative and quantitative analysis of relevant themes.
Internally, we support the sales and trading desks through customized
analytics, by providing visibility to clients.</p>

<h4>What is the most challenging part of your job?</h4>
<p>Credit derivative products are quite complex from a modeling
perspective. Publishing research on these products requires us
to be competent in both fundamental and technical issues that
affect the securities. The challenging part is translating these
complex themes into actionable and commercial research.
The ability to explain difficult ideas in simple words to a large
audience is an excellent trait to possess as a Research analyst.</p>

<h4>I remain here because&#133;?</h4>
<p>Research is a highly entrepreneurial job requiring constant
innovation and idea generation. What I appreciate
most about the job is the creative freedom that
comes with it. The people I work with are extremely
talented and supportive. We work very well as a
team and have succeeded in building a good credit
derivatives franchise.</p>

<h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at
Bank of America?</h4>
<p>Be open-minded, willing to learn and explore new ideas. Learn to identify the
opportunities provided for professional advancement. Develop the ability to
adapt to circumstances quickly – the industry is going through some very
rapid changes.</p>

<h4>If you participated in a summer intern programme, describe your experience and the value of your internship.</h4>
<p>I interned for ten weeks as part of the Summer Quant Research programme in 2007. The
internship consisted of three projects, each with a different team in Research. It gave me
a chance to work with and meet people across various areas in Research and was invaluable in
making an informed decision regarding the area in which I wanted to work. The wider intern class
had close to 200 people, and we had a number of events to network among ourselves and with
those working in different business areas – it was a great experience.</p>
