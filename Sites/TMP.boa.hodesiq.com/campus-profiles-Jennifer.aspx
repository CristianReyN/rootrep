    <h4>Who is the most influential person in your Bank of America career?</h4>
    <p>My manager has, and continues to be, the most influential person in my 
      career. In addition to business results, my manager values the importance 
      of teaching, personal effectiveness, and mentorship. He consistently meets 
      with me to review various business-related topics that help broaden and 
      deepen my understanding of the business. </p>
    <h4>Describe your experience and the value of your experience in the Bank 
      of America summer intern program. </h4>
    <p>An internship is extremely valuable because it provides a glimpse into 
      the types of the daily functions and responsibilities that will ultimately 
      be a part of a full-time role. During my internship, I was given an analyst 
      team project, assigned to give an individual presentation of my choice, 
      and invited to numerous events with senior management. It was also a great 
      opportunity to meet fellow analysts through various team building activities. 
    </p>
    <h4>What other activities do you enjoy outside of your work day?</h4>
    <p>I enjoy playing tennis, studying Arabic, and traveling. I am active in 
      both Sponsors for Educational Opportunity (SEO) and the Association of Latino 
      Professionals in Finance and Accounting (ALPFA). </p>
    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I currently sit on the Listed Options Desk where my main responsibilities 
      include: helping Financial Advisors (FAs) understand options strategies; 
      developing marketing plans that leverage a broad range of resources; and 
      executing options orders for private clients. </p>
    <h4>What is the most challenging part of your job?</h4>
    <p>The most challenging aspect is translating and explaining options strategies 
      so that any investor can feel comfortable executing an options order. Often 
      I serve as an advisor's first stop when he or she is considering incorporating 
      options into his or her business mix and, with options, first impressions 
      can mean everything. </p>
    <h4>What was the best deal/project you worked on?</h4>
    <p>In an effort to drive business, catapult FAs ahead of the competition, 
      and ultimately improve client experiences, I have been working on centralizing 
      and revamping the various marketing channels, including a new internal website, 
      a unified presentation system, and various other automated enhancements. 
    </p>
    <h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
    <p>I applied to the Sponsors for Educational Opportunity (SEO) internship 
      program and was placed in its Asset Management (portfolio management) program. 
      From there, I was assigned to the Listed Options Desk as an intern and returned 
      in 2008 as a full-time analyst. Like many who are offered full-time positions, 
      the real question becomes, why come back? To that I would answer, "it's the people."</p>
