    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>My advice to a potential candidate would be to not be afraid of pursuing 
      any opportunity that is presented to them. I applied to the London office 
      while studying at Northwestern University in Chicago. All my interviews 
      were conducted over the phone and the Human Resources department ensured 
      that the process ran smoothly. </p>
    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I am currently a second-year analyst covering the Natural Resources portfolio 
      in EMEA Corporate Debt Products. My principle responsibilities include conducting 
      credit analysis of the clients in our current portfolio as well as analyzing 
      potential new clients. This entails determining the credit worthiness of 
      companies by analyzing their financial results, analyzing their competitive 
      position and evaluating the sources of repayment for debt products provided 
      to the companies, and assessing potential key risks that may undermine these. 
    </p>
    <h4>What was the best deal/project you worked on?</h4>
    <p>I recently worked on a leveraged buyout transaction for an Italian client. 
      Given the current market environment, it was an interesting transaction 
      as most companies are trying to de-leverage at this stage. Furthermore, 
      I was able to travel to Rome to meet the client and carry out due diligence. 
      This helped me immensely in my analysis of the company and in determining 
      the risks and rewards to the bank in entering such a transaction. </p>
    <h4>I remain at Bank of America because...?</h4>
    <p>Bank of America helps me maintain a healthy work-life balance while providing 
      a challenging work environment with a steep learning curve. Further, what 
      really separates Bank of America from other institutions is the friendliness 
      of the people. </p>
    <h4>What is the best thing about living and working in your location?</h4>
    <p>With the addition of the Merrill Lynch franchise, we have increased our 
      reach across Europe making London an even more important business center 
      for the bank. From a personal perspective, living in London provides great 
      opportunities to travel across Europe. </p>
