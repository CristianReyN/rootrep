    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I currently work as a Model Point of Contact (MPOC) for Credit Card and 
      Small Business models used in Global Consumer and Small Business Banking. 
      The MPOC's are the principle liaisons between the lines of business and 
      the Corporate Model Governance team, and they help collaborate to create 
      efficiencies within the process. I have also become proficient with the 
      Model Governance System of Record&ndash;an electronic platform used to warehouse 
      the model inventory and required documentation and approvals. </p>
    <h4>What is the most challenging part of your job?</h4>
    <p>My current rotation presents many interesting challenges but one of the 
      hardest was absorbing the large amount of detailed information for each 
      of the models that is used by the businesses. The sheer quantity of models 
      warehoused can be intimidating. Another challenging part is working closely 
      with associates who have advanced degrees in statistics and mathematics, 
      when my undergraduate training was not as intensive in those areas. This 
      creates a need to improve communications to make sure that everything is 
      conveyed correctly and the impact and importance understood. It has given 
      me a great opportunity to improve both my communication and analytical skills. 
    </p>
    <h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
    <p>The main driver in my decision to choose Bank of America was the genuine 
      commitment to the management rotational programs. I wanted the chance to 
      be able to experience several different roles and get exposure to as much 
      as possible. Bank of America offered a diverse and comprehensive product 
      offering that allowed me the potential to experience the broad scope of 
      the financial industry, and at the same time help me narrow my interests. 
      After understanding the support and learning opportunities available, I 
      realized that the rotational program was the right fit for me and would 
      help me in reaching my long term goals for my future career. </p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>If you are interested in a career at Bank of America, you want to ask probing 
      questions about the work environment and culture to get a good understanding 
      before you begin pursuing. The size is a great advantage that has countless 
      opportunities, but it is not the best fit for every personality type. The 
      culture is very performance-driven, placing less emphasis on things like 
      where you went to school. If you perform well and are willing to learn, 
      the doors will always open up. </p>
