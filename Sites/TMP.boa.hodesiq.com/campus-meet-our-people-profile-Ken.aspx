    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
<p>I work on the Equity Central Risk Desk and look after the index rebalancing
product. In other words, I make sure the floor is kept updated when indices adjust
to reflect the market at that time, as well as making sure tracking baskets are
correctly hedged for such events. I also execute various special situation trades
from simple sector pair trades to rights issue arbitrage trades. We also
frequently deal with clients on risk across the European equity universe in
varying sizes from $50k to $4mm and handle the unwinding of that risk.</p>

<h4>What is the most challenging aspect of your job?</h4>
<p>The variety of different mandates the desk deals with on a daily basis.
We always have to be switched on during the day as it can be very
intense and there’s a need to adapt to a variety of challenges. We
frequently have to tackle numerous different tasks from creating an
index rebalancing model to manually trading a spread, simultaneously.</p>

<h4>I remain here because&#133;?</h4>
<p>I get on extremely well with the people in my team and thoroughly
enjoy the responsibility that I’m given. The potential to learn new
things daily is huge, and I feel there’s so much more I can
absorb. The franchise is strong in the European equities
space, which is a big bonus.</p>

<h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at
Bank of America?</h4>
<p>Definitely explore the opportunity – attend the many recruiting events specially designed
for that purpose, read around the industry and the economy and apply for an internship
to get a flavour for the business.</p>

<h4>Describe your experience and the value of your internship.</h4>
<p>I spent ten weeks on a Global Markets Summer Internship. We spent one
week learning about the different asset classes in the classroom and
spent the other nine weeks on the floor, equally divided between
foreign exchange and equity trading. Proved to be a great opportunity
to work on both the fixed income and equity floors and gave an
amazing first hand insight of the business. The opportunity to
compare and contrast the two different markets was fascinating.</p>

<h4>What other activities do you enjoy outside of your work day?</h4>
<p>I was born and grew up in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, before moving
to the UK. I’m a big sports fan; play and watch football on a
frequent basis.</p>
