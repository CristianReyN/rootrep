    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I have responsibility for distribution strategy/pricing and execution
across leveraged and investment grade syndicated loans as well as
high yield bond transactions with the aim of helping clients to
raise capital from investors.
</p>
   
    <h4>What was the best deal/project you worked on?</h4>
    <p>As part of an M&amp;A sole advisory mandate, we helped a
client to finance a 100% cash acquisition by structuring and
underwriting a bridge loan facility of $1.5 billion. The client
was subsequently able to acquire the target while we
successfully completed syndication of the bridge facility.
This was evidence for the bank's ability to deliver
integrated advisory and financings solutions to clients.
</p>
   
    <h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
    <p>The opportunity of working with clients to
address strategic, financial and investment
needs as one of the world's premier providers
of corporate finance and investment banking
services.
</p>
    
	<h4>What is the best thing about living and working in your location?</h4>
    <p>London is one of the pre-eminent financial centers of the world, and very internationally flavored. It plays an important role for our global firm, connecting the Americas and Asia via Europe and other key markets around the globe.</p>
   
    <h4>Describe your experience and the value of your experience in the Bank of America summer intern programme.</h4>
    <p>The internship offers real responsibilities and gives you a sense of what you would be doing, day-to-day, as a full-time employee. Moreover, you gain valuable work experience while demonstrating and developing your skills.</p>
