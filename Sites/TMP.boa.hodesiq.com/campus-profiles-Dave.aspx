    <h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
    <p>As an Industrial Engineer, I always assumed I would enter the manufacturing 
      or production environment, but that never seemed the right fit for me. During 
      a job fair my junior year of college, I noticed a Bank of America booth 
      and wondered why a bank would be at an engineering job fair. I spoke to 
      the recruiter who was there and was instantly attracted to all the different 
      opportunities I could have. With my educational background, I had many areas 
      I could move into within the bank. </p>
    <h4>What is the best thing about living and working in your location?</h4>
    <p>Charlotte is a great city to live in. Most people are not originally from 
      Charlotte, so it's a melting pot of different backgrounds. It is a young 
      and growing city and an ideal location for a recent college graduate. There 
      are excellent restaurants, great golf courses, and an exciting night life 
      to bring a nice balance to this "mall" big city. Being part of the Bank 
      of America College Pipeline program also gives you an instant network of 
      young professionals to interact with, both professionally and socially. 
    </p>
    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I am currently a Process Design Consultant for the Customer Experience 
      Team within Corporate &amp; Small Business Bank Technology &amp; Operations. My 
      primary focus is Hoshin planning, measurement, and analysis and project 
      management around initiatives to drive Hoshin goals/results. </p>
    <h4>What was the best project you've worked on?</h4>
    <p>I was the lead for a project to update and consolidate the Solution Center, 
      which is the primary application call center that associates use to search 
      for, and obtain, policy and procedures for handling customer issues. I worked 
      to locate all the Technology and Operations related entries, verify/update 
      the information with line of business subject matter experts, and worked 
      with the Solution Center administration team to implement the changes. This 
      initiative not only saved associates time on calls, but more importantly, 
      ensured the customer was given consistent and accurate information. </p>
