    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
<p>As a sales analyst, I support two Treasury Sales Officers who each
manage their own portfolio of clients. One is part of a team covering
U.S. headquartered multinationals. The portfolios are split by region,
and I am committed to Chicago and its surrounding locations.
The other portfolio I am assigned to consists of clients who
outsource some of their treasury functions to the bank’s
Treasury Outsourcing operation in Dublin. My responsibilities
are split between maintaining existing client relationships and
winning new business.</p>

<h4>What is the most challenging part of your job?</h4>
<p>Working for a global bank in a dynamic industry means both
internal and external communication is paramount. Managing
emails and phone calls are therefore cornerstone to the sales analyst
role. Managing your workload allows you to know what is in your
inbox; this becomes most challenging when you or your
sales officer is out of the office visiting clients. Having
a company Blackberry helps!</p>

<h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
<p>I knew I wanted a client-facing role within banking. Even at analyst level,
Bank of America provides a lot of hands-on experience in the Treasury
space. Being a global bank also creates a lot of internal opportunities
and with the Merrill Lynch merger this is enhanced furthermore.</p>

<h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an
opportunity at Bank of America?</h4>
<p>Bank of America, more than many other companies,
appreciates ‘well rounded’ individuals, so express your
unique self in interviews as much as possible.</p>
