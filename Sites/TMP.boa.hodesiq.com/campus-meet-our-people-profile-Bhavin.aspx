    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    
    <p>I am part of the Basel II Data Quality team at Bank of America. I specifically
    support the retail data with the goal of ensuring that the data is complete
    and accurate for Basel II Regulatory Reporting.
    My principle responsibilities include the following: support end-to-end
    testing; defect analysis and resolution; and post month-end data
    quality reporting, which includes running SQL scripts, compiling into
    reports and performing analysis on the data quality issues.</p>
    
     <h4>What is the most challenging part of your job?</h4>
    <p>The most challenging part of my job is working with a virtual team.
    I was used to working with a team in the same locale and thought
    working virtually would be a challenge. By using the available technology
    and tools, I have not experienced any negative impact from
    working virtually.</p>
    
    
    
    <h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
    <p>Bank of America is a global company. It has a great reputation, and I
    see limitless potential for career growth and opportunity.
    Additionally, Bank of America saw potential in me, despite my
    lack of real-world experience, which further strengthened my
    desire to work for the company.</p>
    
    
    <h4>Who is the most influential person in your Bank of America career?</h4>
    
    <p>One of my colleagues has been the most influential person in my
    Bank of America career. She willingly provided guidance and coaching.
    I believe that she was a true advocate of my potential and for my
    career. During the workday, she made herself available for project
    discussions, reviews or comments about the day-to-day.</p>
    
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank of America?</h4>
    
    <p>If somebody is considering an opportunity at Bank of America, I would recommend the following:</p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>Ask as many questions as possible to the hiring manager.</li>
    <li>Remember to consider ALL your opportunities. The last thing
    you want is to be unhappy.</li>
    <li>Try creating a pro/con list to document what factors are most
    important to you.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>If you participated in a summer intern program at Bank of America,
    describe your experience and the value of your internship.</h4>
    <p>I was fortunate to participate in two summer intern programs prior
    to becoming a full-time associate at Bank of America. These unique
    opportunities allowed me to gain real-world experience. I was
    challenged and given significant and meaningful tasks.</p>
