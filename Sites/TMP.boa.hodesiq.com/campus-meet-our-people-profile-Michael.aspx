    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>My current role is in MQ Support under Mainframe Design and Build. My responsibilities 
      include the support of the installation, configuration, monitoring and maintenance 
      of software on multiple distributed environments in both production &amp; test 
      for several applications at Bank of America. Training has been lined up 
      for me to gain experience on administrating the software on the z/OS Mainframe 
      platform as well. </p>
    <h4>What is the most challenging part of your job?</h4>
    <p>With my current position in the MQ Support group, I have the opportunity 
      to work with multiple Lines of Businesses (LOBs) or different areas at the 
      bank. The understanding of how each of the LOB's applications interact and 
      fit in the big picture can be a challenging task. That knowledge aids in 
      the troubleshooting of those issues. </p>
    <h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
    <p>I attended a Bank of America campus recruiting session held at my school, 
      The University of North Carolina, Charlotte. During that session, the bank's 
      core values, culture, Six Sigma methodology, internship opportunities, ability 
      to move around within the company, and the benefits of being accepted into 
      a College Hire Program were all mentioned. From the topics in the session 
      and those conversations, I decided to follow-up and take a closer look at 
      Bank of America. </p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>I was in the same situation a few short years ago and my advice is to attend 
      Bank of America recruiting events and career fairs at your university/college 
      and talk to the associates about any of your questions or concerns. From 
      personal experience, I can say that the bank has an excellent set of benefits 
      and one of the best working environments to help you develop and excel. 
    </p>
    <h4>Describe your experience and the value of your experience in the Bank 
      of America summer intern program. </h4>
    <p>I was lucky to have participated in an internship here between my junior 
      and senior years in college. Internships as well as College Hire Programs 
      are organized with training and events that promote knowledge sharing and 
      networking. I am still in communication with many of the interns I met that 
      summer. </p>
