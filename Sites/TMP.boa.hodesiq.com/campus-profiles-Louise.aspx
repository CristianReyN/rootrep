	<h4>What is the best thing about living and working in your location?</h4>
    <p>The best thing about working in Hong Kong is the exciting and fast-paced
modern city life. Everything you need&ndash;from your office to your personal
living necessity, such as groceries, to night life&ndash;is within walking distance
24 hours a day. Even the most local residents here have learned to embrace
the multiculturalism everywhere they go. You don't feel out of place being
who you are here.</p>
    
	<h4>What advice would you give to someone considering
an opportunity at Bank of America?</h4>
    <p>Learning the processes is not your goal. Be ready for a
culture where status quo is questioned and challenged.</p>
    
	<h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>Product controller for Strategic Investment Group desk. Currently
doing finance work for the trading desk including: daily profit
and loss analysis and attribution; various monthly accounting
reconciliation; and market-to-market valuation verification
and monitoring.</p>
    
	<h4>What is the most challenging part of your job?</h4>
    <p>The most challenging part of this job is that it requires me to touch
base with almost every other department related to the trading
business: trading desk; price valuation group; settlement team;
core finance; and technology. Familiarity with the responsibility
scope and general work flow of all these counterparties is a must.</p>
    
	<h4>I remain at Bank of America because...?</h4>
    <p>I like the warm and accepting culture of my team. People come
from a vast variety of backgrounds, but we learn to leverage
each other's strengths and differences, while being encouraged
to be ourselves.</p>
