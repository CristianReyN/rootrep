    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I am an Analyst in the Power &amp; Utilities industry sector of Corporate Debt 
      Products. I analyze the credit worthiness of large corporate borrowers and 
      draft documents that aid senior risk executives in making decisions of whether 
      the bank should provide loans to companies. </p>
    <h4>What was the best deal/project you worked on?</h4>
    <p>One memorable deal was a request for a 12 month revolving credit facility 
      from a company who was experiencing severe liquidity issues due to operational 
      challenges at its electric power generation plants and rising commodity 
      prices. As the analyst, I was responsible for drafting the initial credit 
      document, evaluating the company's financial performance, and helping to 
      create a financial model. The team spent several long nights working on 
      the deal and in discussions with the company. In the end, the company was 
      able to secure the required financing, access the public debt market to 
      increase liquidity, and improve operating performance. </p>
    <h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
    <p>I was attracted to the bank's reputation in the financial services industry, 
      broad array of opportunities across the country, and team-based culture. 
    </p>
    <h4>What is the best thing about living and working in your location? </h4>
    <p>Charlotte, NC is the corporate headquarters. Being here, I have the opportunity 
      to attend live presentations led by senior executives, meet employees from 
      different groups within the bank and participate in numerous networking 
      groups/activities. </p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>Do your research. Try to connect with people who are currently working 
      at the bank or in the group you are interested in joining. You may be able 
      to find alumni at the bank through your university's career placement office. 
      Ask these contacts questions about the job responsibilities, group culture, 
      and expectations of new team members. This knowledge goes a long way during 
      the interview process and helps during your transition from college to the 
      office. </p>
    <h4>Describe your experience as an intern at Bank of America.</h4>
    <p>I was an intern in the Financial Sponsors and Healthcare industry sectors 
      of Corporate Debt Products for three months the summer before graduation. 
      While my experience was only a small window into the analyst job, it provided 
      me with the chance to speak directly with analysts about their responsibilities, 
      meet the teams, and understand the role. </p>
    <h4>What other activities do you enjoy outside of your work day?</h4>
    <p>I volunteer as an English and Math tutor for elementary and middle school 
      aged children, take tennis lessons and enjoy working out at the gym (serious 
      stress reliever). </p>
