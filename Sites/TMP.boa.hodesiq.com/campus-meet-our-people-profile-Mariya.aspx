    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>I am currently helping the research team roll out coverage of the packaged 
      food stocks within the consumer space. The process involves writing detailed 
      initiation reports, creating and projecting financial statements, and familiarizing 
      ourselves with company management teams. </p>
    <h4>What is the most challenging part of your job?</h4>
    <p>One of the most challenging aspects of the job is getting up to speed on 
      all of the companies we cover. Because I joined the team fairly recently, 
      I have a lot of catching up to do as far as learning all the industry drivers, 
      as well as the story behind each individual stock. </p>
    <h4>What is the best thing about living and working in your location?</h4>
    <p>Working in the New York headquarters &ndash; both at the World Financial 
      Center and One Bryant Park comes with many advantages. Being able to utilize 
      all the different resources, like access to other lines of business and 
      co-workers within equity research, is a primary example. </p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>This is an ideal place to launch a career. The training program as well 
      as the exposure to all the lines of business provides a great foundation 
      for someone who is just out of college, a perk which many smaller shops 
      do not offer. </p>
