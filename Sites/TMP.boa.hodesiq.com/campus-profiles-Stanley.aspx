    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank of America?</h4>
<p>It is indisputable Bank of America is a global leading financial company providing lots of opportunities. My advice would be to understand clearly the requirements and expectations of the job, the line of business and the firm’s vision and direction. Participating in events like a campus visit or visiting the company web site can accelerate your understanding. You may then set targets of what you want to achieve in three months, one year and three years and evaluate your targets against the opportunity to secure your passions and interests to develop yourself at Bank of America.</p>

<h4>If you participated in a summer intern program at Bank of America,
describe your experience and the value of your internship.</h4>
<p>I began as an intern for a one year program in the Technology department. It was a great learning experience. What's unique about an internship is it gives you a formal period of time to know how well you fit into the company and at the same time to build up your strengths, to develop your interests and to expand your network</p>

<h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
<p>I manage the technology team to support the Global Corporate and Investment Banking (GCIB) group in the Asia Pacific region. My team partners with the GCIB management team in the region, as well as our global technology counterparts, to
deliver value adding technology solutions and provide management reporting and analytics to support the growth
and development of the GCIB business in the region. </p>

<h4>I remain at Bank of America because&#133;?</h4>
<p>Bank of America is now growing its global financial services business to offer the full spectrum of products and services to the market almost everywhere, and I believe Asia Pac has the biggest potential to grow. I believe technology will play a leading role to generate further synergies among Corporate & Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Global Markets to allow client total relationship management and profitability. The technology used by these systems will be cutting edge, and I believe it’s an excellent opportunity to be a member of the pioneering firm to change and lead the financial market in the new era.</p>

<h4>What is the best thing about living and working in
your location?</h4>
<p>Hong Kong has a balanced culture mix, extremely convenient, contrasting and diversified lifestyles, great shopping, absolutely terrific food and a favorable tax system. I have worked in New York, Tokyo and Hong Kong. In my experience, working in Hong Kong is most challenging yet opportunistic.</p>
