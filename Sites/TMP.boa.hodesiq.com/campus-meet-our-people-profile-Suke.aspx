<h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
<p>I work in Market Data Services in the Enterprise Technology & Delivery
Group. My team manages infrastructures which provide market data from
various vendors, trading technologies and also connectivity to stock
exchanges in Asia Pacific. We support both developers and users.</p>

<h4>What is the most challenging part of your job?</h4>
<p>My job duties require timely response because the stock market
will not wait. Short turnaround time is always expected from the
business to deploy new products or to recover from outages.
With the vast amount of services we support, efficiency and
good communication skills are key.</p>

<h4>What is the best thing about living and working in your location?</h4>
<p>Living in one of the world's fastest growing economies, you will
find exciting business opportunities from around the world. Asia
Pacific offices are relatively smaller than the U.S., so young
professionals will often get more exposure and responsibilities.</p>

 <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at
Bank of America?</h4>
<p>Success can be achieved by persistence and your passion. It is important
to understand what your mission in life is because work is also part of it.
If you are looking for a diverse, dynamic environment with a lot of career
opportunities, Bank of America is definitely your choice.</p>

<h4>What other activities do you enjoy outside of your work day?</h4>
<p>Outside of my work, I am active in Girl Guiding where I am a leader of a troop
with 25 teenage girls. Volunteering is a great way to relieve stress while you
give back to your society.</p>
