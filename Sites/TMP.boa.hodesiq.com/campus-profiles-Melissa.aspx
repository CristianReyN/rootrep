    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>As an analyst on the UK Investment Banking team, I am primarily involved 
      in providing advice to UK corporate clients in relation to financing and 
      M&amp;A opportunities. My day-to-day personal responsibilities involve financial 
      modelling, preparing presentations for pitches, going to client meetings 
      and deal execution and management. Our clients work in a variety of sectors, 
      covering an entire spectrum from retail and real estate to E&amp;P and financial 
      institutions. </p>
    <h4>What was the best project you worked on?</h4>
    <p>I was involved in a sell-side M&amp;A transaction for a public oil exploration 
      and development company. The whole process took about 6 months and it was 
      really rewarding to be an integral part of the team. We also encountered 
      a number of different issues during the process, especially in light of 
      the turbulent economic climate, and it was interesting to be involved in 
      the resolution of the problems. </p>
    <h4>I remain here because...?</h4>
    <p>I am continually learning new things and find what I am doing is still 
      rewarding.</p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>Make sure you fully research the position you are applying for. Get some 
      relevant experience. Make the most of recruitment events so you can really 
      match your interests to the available positions and give yourself the best 
      opportunity to stand out in the interview process. </p>
