     <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>My current assignment is to help a China-based real estate company to acquire 
      a Hong Kong Stock Exchange listed public company through reverse takeover. 
      My primary responsibilities include preparing public information books, 
      establishing merger and acquisition models, performing due diligence procedures, 
      and arranging negotiation sessions between various parties. </p>
    <h4>What was the best project you worked on?</h4>
    <p>My first IPO project. I went through the whole IPO procedure including 
      preparing for and presenting the IPO pitch; attending IPO kick-off meeting 
      and prospectus drafting sessions; responding to SEC comment letters; performing 
      due diligence and analysts presentation; arranging road shows and pricing 
      with investors. </p>
    <h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
    <p>Definitely the intelligent people and teamwork culture here. You are working 
      with lots of professionals who are among the best and you never feel you 
      are working alone or wasting your time. Everyone here will help you develop 
      yourself and work efficiently. </p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>Get to know as many Bank of America representatives as possible and learn 
      their unique stories and experiences. </p>
    <h4>If you participated in a summer intern program at Bank of America, describe 
      your experience and the value of your internship. </h4>
    <p>I used to be a Summer Associate with Merrill Lynch Investment Banking based 
      in Hong Kong in 2007. The experiences were fantastic &ndash; it was a fresh 
      start for my career in banking and I also built up a sound foundation when 
      I came back for a full-time position. More importantly, I also made many 
      friends, truly lifetime friends. </p>
    <h4>What other activities do you enjoy outside of your work day?</h4>
    <p>I recently joined a one-day volunteer activity with 20 other associates 
      from various divisions of Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hong Kong to help 
      Crossroads Global Distribution, a not-for-profit organization which takes 
      Hong Kong's quality superseded goods and redistributes them to people in 
      need, locally and internationally. We helped them repaint their logistic 
      center and office building and also attended an intuitive Anti-AIDS learning 
      session. Everyone was exhausted but we all believe it was absolutely meaningful 
      and a great team building experience! </p>
