    <h4>What is your current assignment and primary responsibilities?</h4>
    <p>Throughout the past two years of the Corporate Audit Management Program 
      (CAMP), I have had the opportunity to work on four Audit teams: GWIM Technology, 
      Enterprise Compliance and Risk Mgt (ECARM), Finance and Global Markets. 
      Currently, I am working on the Global Markets team. My principle responsibility 
      on the team is first and foremost to understand the business&ndash;management, 
      products and services, processes, finances and to identify risk. Overall, 
      my principle responsibilities include audit execution, identifying risk/reward 
      trade-offs, issues management and clear communication. </p>
    <h4>What is the most challenging aspect of your job?</h4>
    <p>The most challenging part of my job is balancing a wide array of assignments. 
      At any given point, I can be working on one or two audits, SOX testing, 
      issues management, Six Sigma training and helping to lead the Corporate 
      Audit United Way golf tournament. However, the most challenging part of 
      my job is also the most exciting. </p>
    <h4>What attracted you to Bank of America?</h4>
    <p>Bank of America allows me to grow both personally and professionally. Bank 
      of America gave me the opportunity straight out of college to join a program 
      that allows me to find the right job for my expertise and that I am passionate 
      about. I remain at Bank of America because I see the potential for growth. 
    </p>
    <h4>What is the best thing about living and working in your location?</h4>
    <p>The best thing about living and working in my location is that I love Charlotte! 
      I may be a bit biased since I have lived in Charlotte my entire life, but 
      I really think it is a great city for young professionals. Charlotte is 
      located only two hours from the mountains for skiing and hiking and three 
      hours from both North and South Carolina beaches. </p>
    <h4>What advice would you give to someone considering an opportunity at Bank 
      of America? </h4>
    <p>Someone considering an opportunity at Bank of America has already made 
      the right decision by looking at a company with significant growth potential 
      and opportunities for a long career. I would encourage this individual to 
      make a list of the things that are most important to them in a job (i.e. 
      responsibility, work/life balance, ability to move up within their Line 
      of Business, professional certification, etc.) and discuss these items with 
      their future manager. </p>
